meld_9_8,"Great, I'll see you then."
meld_9_9,Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
meld_9_10,"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""Hey, you're not Bob."""
meld_9_11,"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
meld_9_12,Oh my god. You are pure evil.
meld_9_13,"Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this"

meld_12_0,Hey!
meld_12_1,Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time.
meld_12_2,"Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?"
meld_12_3,What?!
meld_12_4,Whats wrong with you?
meld_12_5,Nothing!
meld_12_6,"Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since."
meld_12_7,"But um, I dont think its anything serious."
meld_12_8,This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
meld_12_9,"No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!"
meld_12_10,Thats a hernia.
meld_12_11,Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
meld_13_0,I love your place! Where is this guy from?
meld_13_1,Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
meld_13_2,"Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs."
meld_13_3,So much more.
meld_14_0,"Well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young."
meld_14_1,Okay
meld_14_2,But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to my apartment.
meld_14_3,Really?!
meld_14_4,Really.
meld_14_5,You dont think this is too fast.
meld_15_0,Get Out!
meld_15_1,"Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?"
meld_15_2,"Yes, please!  So, what's going on?"
meld_15_3,"Uh, well... Joey and I broke up."
meld_15_4,"Oh my God, wh-what happened?"
meld_15_5,"Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!"
meld_15_6,I knew that was him!
meld_15_7,"Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best."
meld_15_8,"Hey, you ok?"
meld_15_9,I guess.
meld_15_10,There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.
meld_15_11,I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.
meld_15_12,"Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker."
meld_15_13,"Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here."
meld_15_14,"Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?"
meld_15_15,Or we could throw you both in
meld_15_16,"Ok, gentlemen!"
meld_15_17,Please!
meld_15_18,Aren't we a little old for this?
meld_15_19,"I mean, we're scientists, right?"
meld_15_20,We're academics.
meld_15_21,And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first.
meld_15_22,"GO, GO, GO!"
meld_16_0,"Go, go, go!"
meld_16_1,"Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!"
meld_16_2,Oy!!
meld_16_3,Whats with all this sand?
meld_16_4,"Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage."
meld_16_5,"Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat."
meld_17_0,"Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later."
meld_17_1,"Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up."
meld_17_2,"If you said, ""Big lima bean, bubbling up."" Would she understand the difference?"
meld_17_3,Rach? What are you doing?
meld_17_4,"Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!"
meld_17_5,It's a diaper commercial.
meld_17_6,"Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!"

meld_18_3,"Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!"
meld_18_4,"Uhh,"
meld_18_5,Okay!
meld_18_6,Uh-oh.
meld_18_7,What?
meld_18_8,I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
meld_18_9,"Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!"
meld_18_10,"I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?"
meld_19_0,Hey.
meld_19_1,Hey!
meld_20_0,How did it go with Erin?
meld_20_1,"Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!"
meld_20_2,"Yay!! Oh so, youre not, youre not mad at us anymore?"
meld_20_3,No!
meld_20_4,No!
meld_20_5,No!
meld_20_6,You guys were totally right!
meld_20_7,This is so much better than the first time we went out.
meld_20_8,Yknow?
meld_20_9,"That was so awkward, we were really nervous."
meld_20_10,Didnt you sleep together?
meld_20_11,"Yeah, that really calms me down."
meld_20_12,And!
meld_20_13,We have so much in common!
meld_20_14,"She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well thats a"
meld_20_15,"Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please dont get married before I do."
meld_20_16,Okay.
meld_21_0,How does she do that?
meld_21_1,I cannot sleep in a public place.
meld_21_2,Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
meld_21_3,Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
meld_21_4,"It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again."
meld_21_5,What's going on with you?
meld_21_6,I got no sleep last night!
meld_21_7,Why?
meld_21_8,"My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed."
meld_21_9,"Oh, and deaf."
meld_21_10,"So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time."
meld_21_11,You have no idea how loud they are!
meld_21_12,"Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight."
meld_21_13,Thanks.
meld_22_0,Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
meld_22_1,"It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?"
meld_22_2,"Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?"
meld_22_3,"Breathe, breathe, breathe."
meld_23_0,"Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead."
meld_23_1,Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
meld_23_2,How can you not know which one?
meld_23_3,I mean thats unbelievable.
meld_23_4,"I mean, was it Gina?"
meld_23_5,Which one is Gina?
meld_23_6,"Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings."
meld_23_7,"No, no, no, thats Dina."
meld_23_8,"You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!"
meld_24_0,"I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny."
meld_24_1,"Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with."
meld_24_2,You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
meld_24_3,Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
meld_24_4,Really!?
meld_24_5,"Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out."
meld_24_6,"I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger."
meld_24_7,"Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?"
meld_24_8,"What should I wear, now Im all nervous."
meld_25_0,": I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!"
meld_25_1,"I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful."
meld_25_2,": Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball."
meld_25_3,"Oh well, okay, good luck."
meld_25_4,: Yeah.
meld_25_5,Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
meld_25_6,": Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think Im ready to dance with girls."
meld_25_7,Okay.
meld_25_8,: Yeah.
meld_25_9,Go get em Treeger.
meld_25_10,": Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend."
meld_25_11,Really?
meld_25_12,": Yeah, you could dance real good with her, shes the same size as me."
meld_25_13,"No, Im good."
meld_26_0,"Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?"
meld_26_1,"Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so"
meld_26_2,Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
meld_26_3,Who knows?
meld_26_4,"Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much."
meld_26_5,Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
meld_26_6,Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
meld_26_7,Yeah!
meld_26_8,"Actually, that can't happen."
meld_26_9,"Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben."
meld_26_10,So it'll be either you two  or you two.
meld_26_11,"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird."
meld_26_12,"Yeah, it is."
meld_26_13,"No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird."
meld_27_0,"Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
meld_27_1,"Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
meld_28_0,Please!
meld_28_1,Are you kidding?
meld_28_2,"I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody noseI mean I-Im not proud of it but, I really am."
meld_28_3,"And its all because of you, wonderful, amazing you."
meld_28_4,I think youve got concussion.
meld_28_5,"No, no, Im serious. Thank you."
meld_28_6,Youre welcome.  Im sorry. Did I hurt you?
meld_28_7,"Its worth the pain.  Yknow what, you know what? Its not."
meld_29_0,Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
meld_29_1,"I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do""  ""I do""."
meld_29_2,"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
meld_29_3,David is going to propose to Phoebe.
meld_29_4,What?  Why?
meld_29_6,"Chandler, we have talked about this."
meld_29_7,You are not supposed to give people advice!
meld_29_8,Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
meld_29_9,I
meld_29_10,They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
meld_29_11,"She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone"
meld_29_12,"Man, that's some"
meld_29_13,"Oh, that's not what you want..."
meld_30_0,"This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller."
meld_30_1,It-its great to meet you Paul.
meld_30_2,I usually prefer Elizabeths boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
meld_30_3,"Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens."
meld_30_4,"So Ross, what your problem?"
meld_30_5,Eh-whExcuse me?
meld_30_6,Why cant you get a girlfriend your own age?
meld_30_7,Thats funny. Umm.  Its not funny.
meld_30_8,I
meld_30_9,Okay.
meld_30_10,"I can, I can see that."
meld_30_11,"Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind."
meld_30_12,Okay.
meld_30_13,What?
meld_30_14,Okay. Ill give you one chance to change my mind.  You got one minute.
meld_30_15,Daddy!
meld_31_0,"Oh well, its not on TV yet."
meld_31_1,"Well, then its not on the wall yet."
meld_31_2,"Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?"
meld_31_3,"So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauers clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that havent been cleaned yet?"
meld_32_0,Ooooohh!

meld_32_2,Was it...?
meld_32_3,"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there."
meld_32_4,"""Ooo,"" what?"
meld_32_5,Uma Thurman.

meld_32_10,You have to tell her!
meld_32_11,You have to tell her!
meld_32_12,"It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!"
meld_32_13,Guys?
meld_32_14,Guys?
meld_32_15,"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
meld_32_16,Feminist issue. That's where I went!
meld_32_17,She is gonna hate me.
meld_32_18,"Yeah, well..."
meld_33_0,Will you marry me?
meld_33_1,Its the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
meld_33_2,"Yeah, yeah you have the ring?"

meld_34_2,"Now, I'm just letting you know that this is"
meld_34_3,Yep! That's hilarious!
meld_34_4,I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
meld_34_5,"Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too."
meld_34_6,"No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times."
meld_34_7,Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
meld_34_8,"Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily."
meld_34_9,What?! You totally get embarrassed!
meld_34_10,"No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are."
meld_34_11,Is that so?
meld_34_12,Yeah.
meld_34_13,Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am
meld_35_0,I cant believe it!
meld_35_1,I did it!
meld_35_2,I rode a bike!
meld_35_3,I never thought Id be able to do that!
meld_35_4,Thank you Ross.
meld_35_5,"Oh hey, dont thank me, thank yourself. Youre the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them."
meld_36_0,"Hey, both you guys should be up there with me."
meld_36_1,"I mean, you two are-are my I mean, Im lucky to have just one good"
meld_36_2,Thanks man.
meld_36_3,I gotta go check something over here.
meld_36_4,What a baby.
meld_36_5,Total wuss!
meld_37_0,"Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on."
meld_37_1,Wow! This looks great!
meld_37_2,"Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna."
meld_37_3,And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
meld_38_0,You kissed another woman!
meld_38_1,Call it even?!
meld_38_2,Okay!
meld_38_3,"Well, Im gonna go get these  in some water."
meld_38_4,Wait you stole those from these peoples wedding?
meld_38_5,"No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby."
meld_38_6,"Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming."
meld_38_7,Hey!

meld_38_9,Ive been looking for this for like a month!
meld_38_10,Oh my God!!
meld_38_11,Oh my God!

meld_39_1,"Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be!"
meld_39_2,Huh?
meld_39_3,Because I sure as hell cant figure it out!
meld_39_4,I talk to you and nothin.
meld_39_5,"You look at me, and its nothin."
meld_39_6,Nothing.
meld_39_7,"Tasty! Im really starting to feel like you guys have a history, its-its nice."
meld_39_8,I have a question about this scene.
meld_39_9,Yes?
meld_39_10,"Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor."
meld_39_11,"Peel the onion. First of all, hes good looking."
meld_39_12,Yeah.
meld_39_13,I think my characters gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
meld_39_14,"Oh, hey, how about this one."
meld_39_15,"Ah, its says so in the script!"
meld_39_16,"Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch."
meld_39_17,It doesnt say that in the script.

meld_41_2,Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
meld_41_3,Sure. So how long you been...
meld_41_4,"Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?"
meld_41_5,Since then?!
meld_41_6,"No, it's only been six years."
meld_41_7,I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.
meld_41_8,...Joe.
meld_41_9,Y'ever been in love?
meld_41_10,...I d'know.
meld_41_11,Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
meld_41_12,You're one to talk.
meld_41_13,"Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women."
meld_41_14,Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
meld_41_15,"Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
meld_42_0,"Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?"
meld_42_1,"Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league."
meld_43_0,"Hey, Rach, how was work?"
meld_43_1,"Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair."
meld_43_2,"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
meld_43_3,"Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming."
meld_43_4,"Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and..."
meld_43_5,Something wrong?
meld_43_6,No. Nothing.
meld_44_0,"And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century."
meld_44_1,"Yeah, that's it?"
meld_44_2,Yeah.
meld_45_0,"Dude, I am sorry about what I said!"
meld_45_1,"No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!"
meld_45_2,Its not that bad.
meld_45_3,"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
meld_45_4,"So, youre just Bing?"
meld_46_0,Because we won our apartment back!

meld_46_13,"Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!"
meld_46_14,No they didnt!
meld_47_0,"You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?"
meld_47_1,It's gonna be worth it.
meld_47_2,"It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?"
meld_47_3,Women love guys who love babies.
meld_47_4,It's that whole sensitive thing.
meld_47_5,"Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there."
meld_47_6,Maybe one of them will break away.

meld_47_17,"Well, we are great guys."
meld_48_0,Bye.
meld_49_0,"Well, not really."
meld_49_1,"I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon."
meld_49_2,"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou."
meld_49_3,"Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents."
meld_49_4,Yeah. What-what should I do?
meld_49_5,"Well Ross, it seems pretty clear."
meld_49_6,I mean whats more important?
meld_49_7,"What people think or how you feel, huh?"
meld_49_8,"Ross, you gotta follow your heart."
meld_49_9,Joey that is so sweet.
meld_49_10,Hey.
meld_49_11,"Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?"
meld_49_12,I couldnt do it.
meld_49_13,You couldnt do it?!
meld_49_14,"Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight."
meld_49_15,What?! Youre going out with her again!
meld_49_16,Going out with who?
meld_49_17,"Uh, Dana Keystone from college."
meld_49_18,Oh yeah! Wasnt she uh
meld_49_19,"No, that was Dana Caplin."
meld_49_20,Joey! You didnt even know her!
meld_49_21,Ah whatever!
meld_50_0,"Morning! Hey, hows my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!"
meld_50_1,Dont touch him!
meld_50_2,Okay!
meld_50_3,All right.
meld_50_4,"Umm, all right Wayne, level with me."
meld_50_5,I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.
meld_50_6,"Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part!"
meld_50_7,"Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!"
meld_50_8,"I mean, I love-I love this little guy!"
meld_50_9,Ah-ah!!
meld_50_10,"Okay, thats why you didnt want me to touch him right?"
meld_50_11,Here you go!
meld_50_12,Okay?
meld_50_13,Stupid!
meld_50_14,I cant believe it!
meld_50_15,God!
meld_50_16,"Hey, how you doin?"
meld_51_0,Hey.
meld_51_1,"Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier..."
meld_51_2,"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed."
meld_51_3,I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
meld_51_4,For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
meld_51_5,You had no
meld_51_6,"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
meld_51_7,"But I told you, I didnt have the time!"
meld_51_8,"Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel."
meld_51_9,"Wh, Ross what do you want from me?"
meld_51_10,"You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?"
meld_52_0,I know.
meld_52_1,"Ooh, I have to tell you something."
meld_52_2,What?
meld_52_3,But I cant tell you.
meld_52_4,"Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me."
meld_52_5,"Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell, and I swore to like all my gods."
meld_52_6,Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
meld_52_7,No.
meld_52_8,Does it have to do with Joey?
meld_52_9,No.
meld_52_10,Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
meld_52_11,"No, but lets come back to that later!"
meld_53_0,Hi!
meld_53_1,Richard!
meld_53_2,"Actually, Im not here to complement the chef."
meld_53_3,"Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef."
meld_53_4,Like I have nothing better to do!
meld_53_5,So whats up?
meld_53_6,"Well, it was great seeing you the other night."
meld_53_7,"Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?"
meld_53_8,No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you.
meld_54_0,"One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay."
meld_54_1,So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
meld_54_2,"Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!"
meld_54_3,"Joey, I am scared to death about this."
meld_54_4,"But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help."
meld_54_5,And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time.
meld_54_6,"You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap."
meld_54_7,"Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me?"
meld_54_8,Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!
meld_54_9,And youre my big brother!
meld_54_10,"I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world."
meld_54_11,Im not even scared to tell mom and dad.
meld_54_12,I was scared of telling you.
meld_54_13,"Well Id be scared of them, but all right."
meld_54_14,"Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me."
meld_54_15,I want him to have his uncle.
meld_54_16,Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
meld_54_17,Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey!
meld_54_18,"Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us."
meld_54_19,Thats right! By his uncle too!
meld_54_20,And by you.
meld_54_21,"Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment."
meld_54_22,Come here!
meld_54_23,No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?!
meld_55_0,I had a really nice time tonight.
meld_55_1,So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
meld_55_2,"I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch."
meld_55_3,You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw
meld_55_4,"Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel."

meld_56_0,"Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre."
meld_56_1,"Hi Mom, it's Jill."
meld_56_2,"She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!"
meld_56_3,"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule."
meld_56_4,Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
meld_56_5,"I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy."
meld_56_6,"Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was"
meld_57_1,Are you seeing anybody right now?
meld_57_2,"Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im not gay, Im not asking you out."
meld_57_3,Im not-Im not-Im not gay!
meld_58_0,Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
meld_58_1,Uh-huh.
meld_58_2,That sounds great!
meld_58_3,Hey!
meld_58_4,"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended."
meld_58_5,Theres gravy?
meld_58_6,If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.
meld_58_7,"That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now."
meld_58_8,What are you doing?
meld_58_9,I think I left a donut up here.

meld_61_3,"Well, what about you?"
meld_61_4,Youre not feeling left out or anything are ya?

meld_61_6,"Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you?"
meld_61_7,"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
meld_61_8,"Now get on out of here, you!"

meld_62_5,Yeah!
meld_62_6,Oh then you know each other.
meld_62_7,Were on a semi-first name basis.
meld_62_8,What do you think of adding him to our team?
meld_62_9,"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes."
meld_62_10,Really? They love him down on six.
meld_62_11,But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here.
meld_63_0,Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
meld_63_1,A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
meld_63_2,"No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!"
meld_63_3,What?
meld_63_4,Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.
meld_63_5,You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux!
meld_63_6,So?
meld_63_7,SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
meld_64_0,"Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say ""I do,"" hes thinking, ""Yeah, Id do her too!"""
meld_64_1,Well then we still have a problem.
meld_64_2,Yeah!
meld_64_3,With what?
meld_64_4,"Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies."
meld_64_5,Oo! You should have one of us do it!
meld_64_6,"Phoebe, were getting"
meld_64_7,No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
meld_64_8,I call it!!
meld_64_9,What?! No! It was my idea!
meld_64_10,Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
meld_64_11,Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
meld_64_12,"We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!"
meld_65_0,"See, I see.... big passion in your future."
meld_65_1,Really?
meld_65_2,I do.
meld_65_3,"Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]"
meld_66_1,"That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why."
meld_66_2,"Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions."
meld_66_3,"Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
meld_66_4,"Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side."
meld_66_5,What?!?!
meld_66_6,"Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill."
meld_66_7,You can spill. In the sink.
meld_66_8,"Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening."
meld_66_9,"I love you, too."
meld_66_10,"Aww, good.  What?"
meld_66_11,What? Im just said.
meld_66_12,"No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is."
meld_67_0,Oh my God! Are you serious?!
meld_67_1,Uh-huh.
meld_67_2,I would love to live with you Ross.. thats-thats great! Thank you!
meld_67_3,"Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out."
meld_67_5,"Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!"
meld_67_6,"I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless."
meld_67_7,You just saved me!
meld_67_8,Youre my hero!
meld_67_9,"Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right."
meld_67_10,"Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!"
meld_67_11,"Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya?"
meld_67_12,No.
meld_67_13,"No, I wont."
meld_67_14,"But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise."
meld_67_15,"She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!"
meld_68_0,"...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?"
meld_68_1,"Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
meld_68_2,Lose the robe.
meld_68_3,Me?
meld_69_0,That's great.
meld_69_1,"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
meld_69_2,"No, no, I'm still working on mine."
meld_69_3,That's it?
meld_69_4,"Yeah, it was really hard."
meld_69_5,"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
meld_69_6,"Ok, you weren't there."
meld_70_0,"Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!"
meld_70_1,Pretty nice?
meld_70_2,"Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
meld_70_3,"We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe."
meld_70_4,"Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe."
meld_70_5,You gotta take the canoe!
meld_70_6,"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!"
meld_70_7,Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
meld_70_8,Good for you!!
meld_71_0,Pheebs?
meld_71_1,Yeah?
meld_72_0,"Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen."
meld_72_1,One ticket to Yemen?
meld_72_2,"Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
meld_72_3,"Im sorry sir, I dont understand."
meld_72_4,What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
meld_72_5,Are you travelling with a child?
meld_72_6,No.
meld_72_7,"All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card."
meld_73_0,"Okay, but this is the last time."
meld_73_1,"With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there."
meld_73_2,"Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen."
meld_73_3,Hey.
meld_73_4,Hey.
meld_73_5,Hows she doing?
meld_73_6,She?
meld_73_7,"Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?"
meld_73_8,"I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly."
meld_73_9,"Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks."
meld_73_10,Excuse me?
meld_73_11,What?
meld_74_0,"Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince."
meld_74_1,"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
meld_74_2,"Well sensitive is important, pick him."
meld_74_3,Yeah.
meld_74_4,"Oh sure, go with the sissy."
meld_74_5,Jason is not a sissy!
meld_74_6,"Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler."
meld_75_0,Hi.
meld_76_0,"So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?"
meld_76_1,Yeah.
meld_76_2,"Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesnt matter."
meld_76_3,"I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way."
meld_76_4,I mean if you hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve.
meld_76_5,It was an amazing night.
meld_76_6,It was. It was an amazing night.
meld_76_7,You think it looked amazing?
meld_77_0,Do we have a name yet?
meld_77_1,"No, not yet."
meld_77_2,"Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green."
meld_77_3,"Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green."
meld_77_4,Hello baby girl.
meld_78_0,"Ah-ha, nowhere to run!"
meld_78_1,I dont like sitting up here! Im just gonna over

meld_79_1,Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!
meld_79_2,Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys!
meld_79_3,Really?
meld_79_4,Yeah! Look!
meld_79_5,Ive never lived like this before.
meld_79_6,I know.
meld_79_7,"All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food."
meld_80_0,"Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?"
meld_80_1,"I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!"
meld_80_2,"Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so"
meld_80_3,Also so
meld_80_4,"Oh, in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!"
meld_80_5,"Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!"
meld_81_0,"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you."
meld_81_1,About what?
meld_81_2,He's planning your birthday party.
meld_81_3,Oh my God! I love him!
meld_81_4,You'd better act surprised.
meld_81_5,About what?
meld_81_6,My surprise party!
meld_81_7,What surprise party?
meld_81_8,Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
meld_81_9,"Well, he didn't tell me."
meld_81_10,"Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing."
meld_81_11,This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
meld_81_12,"No, you are not. We tell you stuff."
meld_81_13,Yuh-huh!
meld_81_14,I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
meld_81_15,I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
meld_81_16,Looks like I was second to last.
meld_82_0,"Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad."
meld_82_1,"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation."
meld_82_2,Chandler! Hes your father.  he should be at the wedding.
meld_82_3,I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years.
meld_82_4,Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
meld_82_5,Its not like we run in the same circles.
meld_82_6,"I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas."
meld_82_7,"Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles."
meld_82_9,Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
meld_82_10,So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care.
meld_82_11,"Okay, I think I need to do some shopping."
meld_83_0,Hello! Whos in there?
meld_83_1,How ya doin?
meld_83_2,Who in the hell are you?
meld_83_3,"I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?"
meld_84_0,"No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!"
meld_84_1,"No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!"
meld_84_2,Im not gonna marry Chandler!
meld_84_3,Not after this!
meld_84_4,"Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo."
meld_84_5,I gotta go.
meld_84_6,"Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it."
meld_85_0,"Sorry I'm late, but I left late."
meld_85_1,Okay.
meld_85_2,"So Pheebs, what is the book about?"
meld_85_3,I thought you said you read it in high school.
meld_85_4,"Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?"
meld_86_0,"Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?"
meld_86_1,"Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?"
meld_86_2,I thought you didn't smoke.
meld_86_3,"Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?"
meld_86_4,"Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?"
meld_86_5,"And I actually, I thought to myself, ""Wow, those guys are crazy!"""
meld_86_6,"But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time."
meld_86_7,We get high.
meld_86_8,"Oh, me too."
meld_86_9,I'm kidding.
meld_86_10,"Oh, me too."
meld_87_0,"Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
meld_87_1,Yeah.
meld_87_2,Does it still hurt?
meld_87_3,Yeah.
meld_87_4,What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
meld_87_5,Hi.
meld_87_6,"Hey, how'd it go?"
meld_87_7,Excellent.
meld_87_8,"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves."
meld_87_9,"What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
meld_88_0,You know what? You are right. I
meld_88_1,Good for you Pheebs!
meld_88_2,Ok.
meld_88_3,"Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean"
meld_89_0,This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired!
meld_89_1,Its 6:00.
meld_89_2,Hi!
meld_89_4,"Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well."
meld_89_5,Handling it?
meld_89_6,"What do you mean, handling it?"
meld_89_7,Theres nothing to handle.
meld_89_8,"Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua."
meld_89_9,"Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway!"
meld_89_10,What?
meld_89_11,Come on!
meld_89_12,They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous!
meld_89_15,"And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off."
meld_89_16,"Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres."
meld_90_0,What the hell is this?!
meld_91_0,"What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?!"
meld_92_0,This sucks!
meld_92_1,"All right, whats my next present?"
meld_93_0,"All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?"
meld_93_1,Enhh
meld_93_2,Ive got canned goods.
meld_93_3,"Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!"
meld_93_4,"Excellent hole, Joe."
meld_93_5,Oh no! No!! My hole!!
meld_93_6,Ow!! Ow!!!
meld_93_7,What?! What?!! What is it?!
meld_94_0,My drinking?
meld_94_1,"Oh, I mustve said that after you left."
meld_94_2,Said what? Exactly.
meld_94_3,That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.
meld_94_4,"Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person!"
meld_94_5,Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!
meld_94_6,If youre gonna get all sensitive about it!
meld_94_7,I dont want to lose you.
meld_94_8,"What if I, create a position for you?"
meld_94_9,Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department.
meld_94_10,Say more things like that.
meld_94_11,"You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow."
meld_94_12,Id need an expense account.
meld_94_13,Done!
meld_94_14,And an assistant.
meld_94_15,"Sophie, get in here!"
meld_95_0,Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
meld_95_1,Oh my!
meld_95_2,They're male nurses.
meld_95_3,Not in my head.
meld_95_4,"Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?"
meld_95_5,Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
meld_95_6,What?
meld_95_7,What are you talking about?!
meld_95_8,You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
meld_95_9,"I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me."
meld_95_10,"Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go."
meld_95_11,"Umm, why don't you give"
meld_95_12,What?
meld_95_13,Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
meld_95_14,"Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some"
meld_95_15,Yep! There's always room for
meld_95_16,"Joey, how do you make"
meld_95_17,"Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad"
meld_96_0,"Hello, this is Monica..."
meld_96_1,Yeah???
meld_96_2,Oh...

meld_96_4,Thank you.
meld_97_0,Okay. Lets bring it in.
meld_97_1,"Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me."
meld_97_2,Here you go.
meld_97_3,That almost hit me in the face.
meld_98_1,"Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right."
meld_99_0,Hey!
meld_99_1,Hey!
meld_99_2,Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
meld_99_3,"Oh boy, me too!"
meld_99_4,Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
meld_99_5,Yeah?
meld_99_6,"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!"
meld_99_7,"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!"
meld_99_8,Thats me! Come on!
meld_99_9,"Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch."
meld_99_10,"Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
meld_99_11,Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
meld_99_12,I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
meld_99_13,Hi! Nice to meet you!
meld_99_14,Nice to meet you too.
meld_99_15,"So, are you ready to go?"
meld_99_16,Yeah.
meld_99_17,Chandler!
meld_99_18,Ill be right with you.
meld_100_0,"Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple."
meld_100_1,Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
meld_100_2,You can take it off.
meld_100_3,Just slice that baby right off!
meld_100_4,"Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?"
meld_100_5,Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
meld_100_6,Well that's not a third nipple.
meld_100_7,No?
meld_101_0,"First of all, it's on your ass."
meld_101_1,"Well then, what is it?!"
meld_102_0,"Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?"
meld_102_1,I'm with Hamilton!
meld_102_2,"He's good with rear things, bring him in too."
meld_103_0,"Umm, this is great wine."
meld_103_1,"Its from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe. Yknow umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe."
meld_103_2,Really?
meld_103_3,"Uh-hmmWait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona."
meld_103_4,I studied for a year in Barcelona.
meld_103_5,"Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking"

meld_106_1,Why?!!
meld_106_2,"Uh well ummwere just not in that place, yknow? But were very excited about this."
meld_106_3,Oh. Well then shut me up.
meld_106_4,Just tell me how.
meld_106_5,"Uh-oh, I feel another one coming."
meld_107_0,"Let it go, Ross."
meld_107_1,"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi."
meld_107_2,Do you all promise?
meld_107_4,Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
meld_107_5,"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!"
meld_107_6,"Hey, Pheebs."
meld_107_7,Dear Ms. Buffay.
meld_107_8,Thank you for calling attention to our error.
meld_107_9,We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.
meld_107_10,"We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -"
meld_108_0,"Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the"
meld_108_1,"Honey, both yours."
meld_108_2,Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
meld_108_3,Yeah? The work problem?
meld_108_4,Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
meld_108_5,What problem did you tell him you had?
meld_108_6,"Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay."
meld_109_0,"Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?"
meld_109_1,"No thanks, Mom!"
meld_109_3,"Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha!"
meld_109_4,"Very good,  so good."
meld_109_5,"I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic."
meld_109_6,"Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call."
meld_109_7,I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.
meld_109_8,"Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!"
meld_109_9,Come on! Look where you are!!
meld_109_10,"When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris."
meld_109_11,"Remember, a virgin for me please."
meld_109_12,Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
meld_109_13,"Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy."
meld_109_14,"Well, if you think it will help."
meld_109_15,No!
meld_109_16,That was a test!
meld_109_17,In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!
meld_109_18,"And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice"
meld_109_19,You should! How is she?
meld_109_20,Ohhh!!
meld_109_21,I think somebody needs another lap dance.
meld_110_0,"All right, I definitely taste nutmeg."
meld_110_1,You do?
meld_110_2,"You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman."
meld_110_3,That and arrogance.
meld_110_4,Hey.
meld_110_5,Hey! How was sailing?
meld_111_0,Wow thanks!
meld_111_1,Joe?
meld_111_2,Yeah!
meld_111_3,"Uh, youve had a lot of sex right?"
meld_111_4,"When? Today? Some, not a lot."
meld_111_5,"Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt."
meld_111_6,"There huhhmm, there-there was an incident."
meld_111_7,"Dont worry about that man, that happens."
meld_111_8,Its happened to you?
meld_111_9,Yeah! Once.
meld_111_10,"Well, whatd you do?"
meld_111_11,I did it anyway.
meld_111_12,Sup? Sup dude?
meld_111_13,"Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me."
meld_111_14,So youre playing a little
meld_111_15,"Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19."
meld_111_16,"Come on man, really how old?!"
meld_111_17,"Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!"
meld_112_0,And they knew about it?
meld_112_1,"Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?"
meld_112_2,"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!"
meld_112_3,"Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just dont know what the big deal is!"
meld_112_4,"The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer."
meld_113_0,"Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
meld_113_1,Do you always have to bring him here?
meld_113_2,I didn't wanna leave him alone.
meld_113_3,Alright?
meld_113_4,We- we had our first fight this morning.
meld_113_5,I think it has to do with my working late.
meld_113_6,"I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces..."
meld_113_7,"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
meld_113_8,"Oh, that'd be great!"
meld_113_9,"Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
meld_113_10,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
meld_114_0,Check this out.
meld_114_1,It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
meld_114_2,"""Its almost as good as being there."""
meld_114_3,Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!
meld_114_4,Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
meld_115_0,"Uh, may I help you?"
meld_115_1,"Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed."
meld_115_2,"Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller."
meld_115_3,"All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
meld_115_4,Nobody sees the king!
meld_115_5,"Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king."
meld_115_6,Hey! You cant go back there!
meld_115_7,Oh my God.
meld_116_0,"So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?"
meld_116_1,"I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore."
meld_116_2,"Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a"
meld_116_3,"Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?"
meld_116_4,Yeah.
meld_116_5,"My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal."
meld_116_6,I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
meld_116_7,"No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me."
meld_117_0,"Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea."
meld_117_1,"Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise."
meld_117_2,"No, I just I think that its too soon."
meld_117_3,"No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven."
meld_118_0,I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
meld_118_1,And now you want that money back.
meld_118_2,Exactly.
meld_118_3,"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?"
meld_118_4,Its not a real game! I made it up!
meld_118_5,"Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square."
meld_119_0,I don't know.
meld_119_1,But I can see through your sheet.
meld_119_2,"Yeah, yeah, that's her."
meld_119_3,But y'know what?
meld_119_4,"Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway."
meld_119_5,Why?
meld_119_6,"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something."
meld_119_7,"What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!"
meld_119_8,No. No. No. She lives on the
meld_119_9,"No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby."
meld_119_10,"And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway."
meld_119_11,You've been counting wrong.
meld_119_12,I did
meld_120_0,"Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this."
meld_120_1,"Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand."
meld_120_2,Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
meld_120_3,"No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me."
meld_120_4,"All right, lets do it."
meld_120_7,"All right, gentlemen, youre up first."
meld_120_8,Okay.
meld_120_9,Okay.
meld_120_10,You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsstop it now. What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
meld_120_11,Big fat goalie.
meld_120_12,Correct. Rachel claims
meld_120_13,Dangerous Liaisons
meld_120_14,Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
meld_120_15,Weekend at Bernies
meld_121_0,"Well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us."
meld_121_1,"Yeah, come on, we can be guys!"
meld_121_2,No you cant.
meld_121_4,"You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long."
meld_121_5,"Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!"
meld_121_6,Okay.
meld_121_7,Im sorry.
meld_122_0,"And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio."
meld_122_1,"You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game."
meld_122_2,"Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men."
meld_122_3,"Pete, can I get you something else?"
meld_122_4,"Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out."
meld_122_5,Havent you and I covered that topic?
meld_122_6,"Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you."
meld_122_7,"Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food."
meld_122_8,"Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth."
meld_122_9,And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.
meld_122_10,"Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you?"
meld_122_11,"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?"
meld_122_12,"I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean."
meld_122_13,"That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know."
meld_122_14,"I mean really, think about it."
meld_122_15,"Ho-ho, I will."
meld_123_0,I believe I read that somewhere!
meld_123_1,"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!"
meld_123_2,Okay?
meld_123_3,Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...
meld_123_4,It's not funny!
meld_123_5,I respectfully disagree.
meld_123_6,I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
meld_123_7,Who cares? Nobody reads those things
meld_123_8,You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
meld_123_9,I don't have a page.
meld_123_10,Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
meld_124_0,I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
meld_124_1,"Okay, what is in here? Rocks?"
meld_124_2,"No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples."
meld_124_3,"So, rocks."
meld_124_4,"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there."
meld_124_5,"Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?"
meld_124_6,"I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move."
meld_124_7,"Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?"
meld_124_8,"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice"
meld_124_9,You
meld_124_10,Why?
meld_124_11,"Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up!"
meld_125_0,"I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you dont think your son will think its yours and be horribly traumatised?"
meld_125_1,"Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra."
meld_125_2,"Ohh, its time to go."
meld_125_3,"Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes."
meld_125_4,"Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?"
meld_125_5,Twice?
meld_125_6,Well thats ambitious.
meld_125_7,"Hey, uh, you can ignore that."
meld_125_8,Thats Carol with your son!

meld_137_0,"Good evening, sir."
meld_137_1,My name is Ross Geller.
meld_137_2,I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.
meld_137_3,And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry.
meld_137_4,"I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you."
meld_137_5,"Man, I wish I was naked."
meld_137_6,"I mean, this-this looks so great."
meld_137_7,That is how God intended it.
meld_138_0,"Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!"
meld_138_1,"But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!"
meld_138_2,"Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!"
meld_138_3,"Okay, you go!"
meld_138_4,My turn? What-what are you talking about?
meld_138_5,"Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler."
meld_138_6,What?!
meld_138_7,"I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, ""I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."""
meld_138_8,"And he said, ""Laundry?"
meld_138_9,Is
meld_138_10,Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
meld_138_11,"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone."
meld_138_12,"Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot."
meld_138_13,What?!
meld_138_14,Mr. Bigot. He tells the most
meld_138_15,All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
meld_138_16,Me and Chandler?!
meld_139_0,"I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off."
meld_139_1,"Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?"
meld_139_2,I don't know! I didn't come with her!
meld_139_3,All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
meld_139_4,A test?!!
meld_139_5,Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!
meld_140_0,"Okay Ive got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?"
meld_140_1,"Id have to saythe talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that youre making me eat him."
meld_140_2,Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry.
meld_141_0,"Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put."
meld_141_1,I think its best sir.
meld_141_2,But we really do need to find someone up here.
meld_141_3,The work is starting to pile up.
meld_141_4,Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
meld_141_5,"Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em."
meld_141_6,Thats a good one.
meld_141_7,What does a guy have to
meld_142_0,"Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico."
meld_142_1,"Hi, Julie!"
meld_143_0,Isnt there a national football league.
meld_143_1,"Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights."
meld_143_2,Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
meld_143_3,"Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?"
meld_143_4,"When theyre hungry enough, theyll come in."
meld_144_0,"Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?"
meld_144_1,"I dont know. You uh, you got something for me?"
meld_144_2,"Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel."
meld_144_3,Ten. Okay. Now Tag theres such a thing as too many women.
meld_144_4,Really?
meld_144_5,"Yeah, for you!"
meld_145_0,"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!"
meld_145_1,That's
meld_145_2,"Hey, I've been honing!"
meld_145_3,What was with the dishes?
meld_145_4,"Oh, uh.."
meld_145_5,I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?
meld_145_6,"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours."
meld_145_7,"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!"
meld_145_8,Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
meld_145_9,"Great, now he's waving back."
meld_145_10,"Man, we gotta do something about that guy."
meld_145_11,"This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment."
meld_145_12,It creeps me out!
meld_145_13,I feel like I can't do stuff!
meld_145_14,What kinda stuff?
meld_145_15,"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked."
meld_145_16,You cook naked?
meld_145_17,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters."
meld_145_18,What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
meld_146_0,Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
meld_146_1,"Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know."
meld_146_2,Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
meld_146_3,You think you know me so well.
meld_146_4,"Well, dont cha wanna?"
meld_146_5,Yeah.
meld_146_6,"Okay, well I do know you."
meld_146_7,Thats what I said.
meld_146_8,Well so?
meld_146_9,I cant.
meld_146_10,I cant.
meld_146_11,"She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone."
meld_146_12,"Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives."
meld_147_0,"Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
meld_147_1,"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
meld_147_2,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
meld_147_3,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
meld_147_4,Nuh-uh.
meld_147_5,Yuh-huh.
meld_147_6,"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
meld_147_7,"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear."
meld_147_8,This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
meld_147_9,No.
meld_147_10,"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
meld_147_11,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my"
meld_148_0,"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
meld_148_1,That's the rule.
meld_148_2,"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
meld_148_3,How'd you get to that?
meld_148_4,"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
meld_148_5,You knew about that?
meld_148_6,"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
meld_148_7,"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
meld_148_8,"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
meld_148_9,Yeah
meld_148_10,You think we're ready for something like that?
meld_148_11,Why not?
meld_148_12,"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
meld_148_13,"Why, are you moving out?"
meld_148_14,I'm not moving out.
meld_148_15,You'd tell me if you were moving out right
meld_148_16,"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
meld_148_17,"Aw, I know all about Kip!"
meld_148_18,"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
meld_148_19,"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
meld_148_20,"Aw, don't do that"
meld_149_0,"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment."
meld_149_1,"Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you."
meld_149_2,"No, I got in trouble for that before. Ill see you later."
meld_149_3,Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.
meld_150_0,Oh my God! Oh my God! Im so sorry!
meld_150_1,"Aw forget it, its from"
meld_150_2,You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!!
meld_150_3,Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
meld_151_0,"Okay! So, well just stay married."
meld_151_1,"Yes, exactly!"
meld_151_2,And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
meld_151_3,"Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more."
meld_151_6,What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!
meld_151_7,"Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?"
meld_151_8,Really?

meld_151_12,Youre right.

meld_151_15,Im asking you to do me a favor.
meld_151_16,You are asking me to be your wife!
meld_151_17,And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
meld_152_0,Oh my God!
meld_152_1,"I know, I know, I'm such an idiot."
meld_152_4,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
meld_152_5,"Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-"
meld_152_6,-leg?
meld_152_7,"That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch."
meld_152_8,You actually broke her watch?
meld_152_9,"Barry, I'm sorry..."
meld_152_10,I am so sorry...
meld_152_11,"I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway..."
meld_153_0,"No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan."

meld_153_4,"I dont know, something girlie."
meld_153_5,"Hey, youre early."

meld_153_7,Im just taking it to be re-wired.
meld_153_8,"Oh, well dont take it to the same place you took the stereo, cause theyve had that thing for over a week."
meld_153_9,"No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here."
meld_153_10,Youre disturbing my oboe practice.
meld_153_11,You dont play the oboe!
meld_153_12,I could play the oboe!
meld_154_0,Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
meld_154_1,"Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me."

meld_155_12,Okay.
meld_156_0,"Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him."
meld_156_1,Go!
meld_156_2,"What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?"
meld_156_3,"I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit."
meld_156_4,I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
meld_156_5,"Oh God Oh, hes in there right now?"
meld_156_6,Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?

meld_161_4,"Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?"
meld_161_5,You don't trust him?
meld_162_0,I think the check in is that way.
meld_162_1,Ahh.
meld_163_0,"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!"
meld_163_1,Well theres some people who do want to marry me.

meld_163_6,Chandler
meld_163_7,You just told me that he hates marriage!
meld_163_8,That-that hes a-a complex fellow whos unlikely to take a wife!
meld_163_9,That-that hes against marriage and always will be!
meld_163_10,You got
meld_164_0,"You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
meld_164_1,I knew.
meld_164_2,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
meld_164_3,I did.
meld_164_4,Oh.
meld_164_5,"Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?"
meld_164_6,Sometime?
meld_164_7,Maybe?
meld_164_8,"Yeah, maybe..."
meld_164_9,"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
meld_165_0,"Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend."
meld_165_1,"Well, youre amazing."
meld_165_2,Oh no-no-no.
meld_165_3,"A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?"
meld_165_4,"Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account."
meld_165_5,"Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had."
meld_165_6,"Oh, I dont know."
meld_165_7,"Oh-no-no-no, you are!"
meld_165_8,"You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that."
meld_165_9,You mean with Casey.
meld_165_10,"No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool."
meld_165_11,Or Casey.
meld_165_12,"No-no, Kathy."
meld_165_13,Could be Casey.
meld_165_14,"No. No, Kathy."
meld_165_15,Consider Casey.
meld_165_16,I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey.
meld_165_17,How bout I fix you two up?
meld_165_18,What do you think?
meld_165_19,That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
meld_166_0,"Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?"
meld_166_1,"Honey, whats the matter?"
meld_166_2,I just saw Janice.
meld_167_0,"Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know....."
meld_167_1,Wow! This girl is good.
meld_167_2,"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before."
meld_167_3,I like her.
meld_167_4,Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
meld_167_5,"Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people."
meld_167_6,Look at you. All jealous.
meld_167_7,"Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more"
meld_167_8,Say you'll stay beside me
meld_167_9,"Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done."
meld_167_10,"Okay, my next songs called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say."
meld_167_11,"I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldnt Have Left You That Way."
meld_167_12,"Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs."
meld_168_0,"Yes, hello."
meld_168_1,I have a question.
meld_168_2,"Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face."
meld_168_3,A beard and a moustache.
meld_168_4,Thank you.
meld_168_5,"No,"
meld_168_6,What?! What else did he say?
meld_168_7,"Umm, he said he thought I was funny."
meld_168_8,"So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it."
meld_168_9,"Ross, no! There is"
meld_168_10,"Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad."
meld_168_11,"Ross, I am a human doodle!!"
meld_168_12,"Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun!"
meld_168_13,"And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna"
meld_168_14,"Okay, there was"
meld_169_0,Come on!
meld_169_1,"Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?"
meld_169_2,"No, its okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I dont"
meld_170_0,Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
meld_170_1,"You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?"
meld_170_2,So?!
meld_170_3,"Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?"
meld_170_4,Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
meld_170_5,"Oh right, right."
meld_170_6,"I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?"
meld_170_7,Well usually...yeah!
meld_170_8,"Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice."
meld_170_9,"Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me."
meld_170_10,Im such a jerk.
meld_170_11,"Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it."
meld_171_0,Hmmm... this is so nice.
meld_171_1,"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
meld_171_2,OK.
meld_171_3,"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
meld_171_4,Ohhh!!!!
meld_171_5,"Yes, yes, that's right..."
meld_171_6,"Oh, look at the little cat!"
meld_171_7,What?  Ow!
meld_172_0,"Well, I was probably going to do it at some point."
meld_172_1,I didn't mean
meld_172_3,It's brilliant!
meld_172_4,"Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!"
meld_172_5,"well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding..."
meld_172_6,"Thank you, Chandler."
meld_172_7,Sincerely.
meld_172_8,"Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help."
meld_172_10,"David, I'm pretending to"
meld_173_0,"Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You cant win if you dont ask any"
meld_173_1,What?!
meld_173_2,"Well, you promised me a fun road trip!"
meld_173_3,Weve been on the road six hours and youve been asleep for five and a half!
meld_173_4,We are switching at the next rest stop and
meld_173_5,All right. All right.
meld_173_6,Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
meld_173_7,Really? I dont
meld_173_8,Sing!!
meld_173_10,Morning!
meld_174_0,Everything was delicious!
meld_174_1,Thank you!
meld_174_2,It was. The duck in particular was superb.
meld_174_3,Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
meld_174_4,Actually I do have one small complaint.
meld_174_5,Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
meld_174_6,The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!
meld_174_7,What musician?
meld_175_0,We did?
meld_175_1,You owe me 20 bucks.
meld_175_2,Thank you. Thank you so much!
meld_175_3,"Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns."
meld_175_4,"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?"
meld_175_5,"What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
meld_175_6,"All right, I'm nine years old."
meld_175_7,"Oh, I hate this story."
meld_175_8,We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
meld_175_9,"I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
meld_175_10,Oh my god.
meld_175_11,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
meld_176_0,"Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
meld_176_1,That little naked guy would be me.
meld_176_2,"Aww, look at the little thing."
meld_176_4,Who are those people?
meld_176_5,Got me.
meld_176_6,"Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'."
meld_176_7,"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
meld_176_8,"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
meld_176_9,Looks like a fun gang.
meld_176_10,"Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
meld_177_0,"So, whats this about?"
meld_177_1,"Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater."
meld_177_2,No.  This is my red sweater.
meld_177_3,Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay.
meld_177_4,Whats going on Rach?
meld_177_5,"Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?"
meld_177_6,"Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called."
meld_177_7,"I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together."
meld_177_8,"Oh, its just not the right time."
meld_177_9,It is the right time.
meld_177_10,Okay.

meld_180_6,Weirdest thing. Did I hearMother of God its true!
meld_180_7,Chandler Bing!
meld_180_8,Janice
meld_180_9,"Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything."
meld_180_10,"Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler."
meld_180_11,Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen?
meld_180_12,Its you. This is yours.
meld_180_13,What?!
meld_180_14,Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years!
meld_180_15,Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
meld_181_0,"Man, Im starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do you want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!"
meld_181_1,"Yknow, yknow Im lookin and I dont think anyones home here."
meld_181_2,"I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and yknow explain later."
meld_181_3,Yeah? Really? No ones home?
meld_181_4,I dont think so. Hello?  When you get in there
meld_182_0,"Hey, what's up?"
meld_182_1,I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
meld_182_2,"Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
meld_182_3,"Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!"
meld_182_4,You had no relationship!!
meld_182_5,"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!"
meld_182_6,"Oh God, stop with the plan!"
meld_182_7,"So what, so what you saw him with a girl?"
meld_182_8,Who cares?!
meld_182_9,That doesn't mean anything!
meld_182_10,"Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl."
meld_182_11,She was kinda stupid.
meld_182_12,You're right.
meld_182_13,"All right, I'm just gonna go on the date."
meld_182_14,I'm gonna go on the date.

meld_184_15,You do that every year??
meld_184_16,I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
meld_184_17,"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??"
meld_184_18,Yeah...
meld_184_19,And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?
meld_184_20,Yeah...
meld_184_21,"OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory?"
meld_185_0,Who's this from?
meld_185_1,"Oh, that's Ross's."
meld_185_2,Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.
meld_185_3,Remembered what?
meld_185_4,It was like months ago.
meld_185_5,"We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl."
meld_185_6,Oh!
meld_185_7,I can't believe he remembered!
meld_185_8,"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
meld_185_9,I can't believe he did this.
meld_185_10,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
meld_185_11,What did you just say?
meld_185_12,F-hah.... flennin....
meld_185_13,Oh.... my God.
meld_186_0,I really like waking up with you.
meld_186_1,"I like waking up with you too.  Oh! It's such a beautiful morning.  Oh, I can stay here all day."

meld_188_6,Jurassic Park
meld_189_0,"I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night."
meld_189_1,Maybe we should check the trash chute.
meld_189_2,Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
meld_189_3,"That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there."
meld_189_4,Hey!
meld_189_5,There he is!
meld_189_6,Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!
meld_189_7,"Just, y'know out."

meld_189_9,What were you doing?
meld_189_10,"I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while."
meld_189_12,He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
meld_189_13,"Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!"
meld_189_14,He hooked up!! Tell us about her!

meld_192_0,"Well, the old lady died."
meld_192_1,And how do I know?
meld_192_2,Her dying wish was for one last kiss.
meld_192_3,"But I dont care,  because you got the apartment."
meld_192_4,Yes!
meld_192_5,Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think Im gonna stay here.
meld_192_6,Isnt that great?
meld_192_7,Ezels!!
meld_193_0,"Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, its not your fault."
meld_193_1,"Wow, thats great."
meld_193_2,"Oh, yeah!"
meld_193_3,"Y'know you could totally sell this. Itd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign."
meld_193_4,"I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no."
meld_193_5,What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
meld_193_6,"Okay, well if I was in this for the money, Id be a millionaire by now, y'know."
meld_193_7,You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
meld_194_0,"Aw, youre right, youre right. Im sorry."
meld_194_1,"Thats okay. All right, Im gonna play song thats really, really sad. Its called Magician Box Mix Up."
meld_195_0,"Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right."
meld_195_1,"Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?"

meld_195_7,Are you serious?  Oh my God.
meld_195_8,Damn! I cant believe I took her off my list.
meld_195_9,Why? Cause otherwise youd go for it?
meld_195_10,"Yeah, maybe."
meld_195_11,"Oh-oh, you lie."
meld_195_12,What you dont think Id go up to her?
meld_195_13,"Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me."
meld_195_14,"Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated."
meld_195_15,"You know what honey, you go ahead, well call her an alternate."
meld_195_16,"Okay, hold my crawler."
meld_195_17,Okay.
meld_195_18,"Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?"
meld_195_19,"Honey, hes about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. Im just sorry we dont got popcorn."
meld_196_0,"Okay, that's, that's enough."
meld_196_1,Won't you dance around with me.

meld_198_1,Pick one.
meld_198_2,Left!  Thank you.
meld_198_3,Youre welcome.
meld_198_4,Ross!
meld_198_5,Joey!  We should just switch.
meld_198_6,Yeah absolutely!
meld_199_0,"Rachel, were sorry for pushing those guys on you."
meld_199_1,Oh thats all right!
meld_199_2,"Yknow, I ended up having a really good time."
meld_199_3,"Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness."
meld_199_4,So what was it for anyway?
meld_199_5,I wanna say a disease.
meld_199_6,Hey!
meld_199_7,Hey!
meld_199_8,I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on
meld_199_9,"Oh my God, look! Thats Elizabeth!"
meld_199_10,Oh-oh Professor Geller.
meld_199_11,"Ahh, to be 13 again."
meld_200_0,"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?"
meld_200_1,No! He blew us off!
meld_200_2,What?!
meld_200_3,I know!
meld_200_4,I cant believe it.  Can I tell you something? Im a little mad at him now.
meld_200_5,Can I tell you something? Me too.
meld_200_6,"Yknow what? He didnt want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we dont talk to him"
meld_200_7,Ooooh! Freeze him out.
meld_200_8,Thats right!
meld_200_9,I like it!
meld_201_0,Doorknob?
meld_201_1,"Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation."
meld_201_2,Oh good.
meld_201_3,"Look, I  Look, Im having a great time with you and I just dont want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us."
meld_201_4,"So, Im sorry I just dont think we should go away together yet."
meld_201_5,Its-its too soon.
meld_201_6,"Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that Im going to Florida for a couple weeks."
meld_201_7,No. I think you misunderstood what
meld_201_8,You are so adorable.
meld_201_9,That! Lets talk about that.
meld_202_0,Hey!
meld_202_1,How do you feel?
meld_202_2,"Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
meld_202_3,"Okay, so I"
meld_202_4,And protected them from a tornado?
meld_202_5,Oh my God.
meld_202_6,"I know, the babies are asleep."
meld_202_7,"Phoebe, what, what happened here?!"
meld_202_8,I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
meld_202_9,But my apartment!
meld_202_12,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
meld_202_13,"Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out."
meld_202_14,Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
meld_202_15,When will that be?
meld_202_16,"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!"
meld_203_0,Hey Ross! The babys kicking!
meld_203_1,What?! It is?!
meld_203_2,Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
meld_203_3,"Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?"
meld_203_4,Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping
meld_203_5,A dreamless sleep.
meld_204_0,"So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!"
meld_204_1,"Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!"
meld_204_2,Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
meld_204_3,Okay.
meld_204_4,When are you coming home?
meld_204_5,"What? Guys, I'm not."
meld_204_6,"C'mon, this is us."
meld_204_7,I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
meld_204_8,Waitressing?
meld_204_9,"Okay, I'm not just waitressing."
meld_204_10,I'm..
meld_204_11,"I, um..."
meld_204_12,"I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh..."
meld_204_13,"I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies."
meld_205_0,"We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?"
meld_205_1,"So, um, will you bring the truck?"
meld_205_2,I'll even let you ring the bell.
meld_205_3,"Oh, my god."
meld_205_4,"See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
meld_205_5,They're nice guys.
meld_205_6,"Oh, they're firemen guys."
meld_206_0,Your son.
meld_206_1,"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie."
meld_206_2,"Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie."
meld_206_3,"What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,"
meld_206_4,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp."
meld_206_5,I got it.

meld_206_8,"No, you don't."
meld_206_9,"All right, that's it. I want both of you out."
meld_206_10,Why?
meld_206_11,He started it!
meld_206_12,"No, you started it."
meld_206_13,"I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier."
meld_206_14,Now go!
meld_206_15,Thanks a lot.
meld_206_16,See what you did.
meld_206_17,"Yeah, listen..."
meld_206_18,Out
meld_207_0,"Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?"
meld_207_1,"Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight."
meld_207_2,Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
meld_207_3,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi."
meld_207_4,"Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times."
meld_207_5,You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.
meld_207_6,Boutros Boutros Gali.
meld_207_7,He says he was too.
meld_207_8,Interesting.
meld_207_9,So I was wondering....
meld_207_10,"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit."
meld_207_11,"Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun."
meld_207_12,So you're a chef?
meld_207_13,Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
meld_207_14,"Oh, really."
meld_207_15,"Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?"
meld_207_16,"Well, I was having a conversation."
meld_207_17,"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other."
meld_207_18,What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
meld_207_19,That would be great. Thank you.
meld_208_0,so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
meld_208_1,"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time."
meld_208_2,When did that happen to you?!
meld_208_3,Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
meld_208_4,"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging."
meld_208_5,"Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it."
meld_208_6,"Oh, damn! I got it on my pants."
meld_208_7,"Here, I'll get it."
meld_208_8,We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
meld_208_9,Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
meld_208_10,"Oh, great!"
meld_208_11,"Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!"
meld_208_12,That was unbelievable!
meld_208_14,"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach."
meld_208_15,I don't believe they're brother and sister.
meld_208_16,They're brother and sister!!!
meld_209_0,Action!
meld_210_0,I found the picture!
meld_210_1,What picture?!
meld_210_2,The picture of my wife! In your pack!
meld_210_3,You went through my personal property?
meld_210_4,Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
meld_210_5,"Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!"
meld_210_6,Cut! Wonderful!
meld_210_7,Great scene yeah?
meld_210_8,"Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me."
meld_210_9,Heres your call sheet for tomorrow.
meld_210_10,I know.
meld_211_0,"So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged."
meld_211_1,"Oh yeah, I should probably call them."
meld_211_2,I remember when we first got engaged.
meld_211_3,"Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story."
meld_211_5,"Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know how that happened."
meld_211_6,You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
meld_211_7,What a sweet story.
meld_211_8,"Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party."
meld_211_9,What?! They wanted a scary story!
meld_211_10,"Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund."
meld_211_11,What?
meld_211_12,"You tell her Jack, I cant do it."
meld_211_13,What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?
meld_211_14,"We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house."
meld_212_0,"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,"
meld_212_1,Did that!
meld_212_2,Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
meld_212_3,Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
meld_212_4,Was it not pain-free?
meld_212_5,"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax."
meld_212_6,"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad."
meld_212_7,Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
meld_212_8,"But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest."
meld_212_9,Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
meld_213_0,"Now umm, remember Im still learning."
meld_213_1,"One, two, three, four!"
meld_213_2,You know the song! Sing along!

meld_214_9,Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
meld_214_10,Yeah.
meld_215_0,Yes! Santa's coming!
meld_216_0,"Hey, uh, Im really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today."
meld_216_1,"Its no big deal. Hey, yknow, you do what you gotta do. Right?"
meld_216_2,"But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides"
meld_217_0,Whatever.
meld_218_1,"Okay, Mon, back me up here."
meld_218_2,"Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?"
meld_218_3,"And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?"
meld_218_4,I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
meld_218_5,"Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal."
meld_218_6,"Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it."
meld_218_7,"Yknow, hey I understand."
meld_218_8,Yknow?
meld_218_9,"Hey, when Im in a play and youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right?"
meld_218_10,"So its yknow, its uh, its cool."
meld_218_11,Ill see you tomorrow.
meld_218_12,"Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave."
meld_219_0,You did look like an idiot.
meld_219_1,"Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot."
meld_219_2,All right?
meld_219_3,"Remember when Ross tried to say, ""Butternut squash?"""
meld_219_4,"And it came out, ""Squatternut buash?"""
meld_219_5,Yeah that's the same.
meld_219_6,That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
meld_219_7,Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
meld_219_8,"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story."
meld_219_9,"Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about."
meld_219_10,"Y'know, for me anyway."
meld_219_11,"And of course, the Indians."
meld_219_12,"Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!"
meld_220_0,"Hi, guys."
meld_220_1,Hi! Phoebe.
meld_220_2,Hi Phoebe.
meld_220_3,"I-I wanted to apologise if Iyknow seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Yknow its just the hormones, yknow."

meld_222_1,"Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?"
meld_222_2,"Yes, hi."
meld_222_3,"Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M."
meld_222_4,"I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im sorry."
meld_222_5,"Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!"
meld_222_6,No leg-chewing for us sir.
meld_222_7,"Oh well, give it time."
meld_222_8,"So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate."
meld_222_9,How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
meld_222_11,"Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six."
meld_222_12,They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
meld_222_13,"Okay, Ill see you tomorrow!"
meld_222_14,"Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow."
meld_222_15,I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.
meld_222_16,Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
meld_222_17,No.
meld_222_18,Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.

meld_223_0,"Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs"

meld_223_8,"Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
meld_223_9,"Yeah, so?"
meld_223_10,"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had."
meld_223_11,"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass."

meld_225_4,"Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery."
meld_225_5,"I got you the best one I could, cause thats not where you want to skimp."
meld_225_6,"Youre a genius, Ross."
meld_225_7,"Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?"
meld_225_8,"Okay, Ill pay you tomorrow."
meld_225_9,"So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?"
meld_225_10,"Yeah, okay, bye."

meld_226_0,"Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party."
meld_226_1,"Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it."

meld_226_19,Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
meld_226_20,I think I need a drink.
meld_226_21,Yeah!
meld_227_0,"Hey, Pheebs?"
meld_228_0,"No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!"
meld_228_1,"Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again."
meld_228_2,"And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready."
meld_228_3,You really think I'm ready?
meld_228_4,Uh-huh!
meld_228_5,Wow! Cool!
meld_228_6,Was the chord at least right

meld_229_4,"And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."

meld_230_1,Im really glad we came.  Youre so pretty. I love you.
meld_231_0,"Okay, thats a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah."

meld_231_4,"But ah, hey, oh, somebodys off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again."
meld_231_5,"Ross youre not listening to me, I dont have time to stop."
meld_231_6,"Come on Rach, you dont have what, ten minutes?"
meld_231_7,I dont have ten minutes!!
meld_231_8,"What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?"
meld_231_9,"Hey, Ross!!! I told you I dont!"
meld_231_10,"Dont yell at me okay, this is the most Ive seen you all week."
meld_231_11,"Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, Ive got a deadline, would you just go home, Ill talk to you later."
meld_231_12,"Yeah, but wait..."

meld_232_2,"When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
meld_232_3,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
meld_232_4,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
meld_232_5,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
meld_232_6,"No, no, no."
meld_232_7,What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
meld_232_8,"Uh, uh."
meld_232_9,Well?
meld_232_10,Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
meld_232_11,Hey.

meld_232_14,"Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?"
meld_232_15,"No, I haven't seen him."
meld_232_16,"Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?"
meld_232_17,"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?"
meld_232_18,"Yeah, why?"
meld_232_19,No reason.
meld_233_0,I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!
meld_233_1,"What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?"
meld_234_1,"Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!"
meld_234_2,"Yeah, thats her."
meld_234_3,Thank you.
meld_234_4,Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!
meld_234_5,Yknow what would work?
meld_234_6,Stop making candy!
meld_234_8,You mean they like you.
meld_234_9,Maybe.
meld_234_10,Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
meld_234_11,"Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?"
meld_235_0,"We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT!"
meld_235_1,"Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?"
meld_235_2,"Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!"
meld_235_3,Cos I was gonna say theres no way you couldve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
meld_235_4,What? We could do it!
meld_235_5,"I dont know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then."
meld_235_6,"I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go."
meld_235_7,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8"
meld_235_8,I cant do it!
meld_235_9,"Now you do that, youre on TV."
meld_236_0,Hey!
meld_236_1,"So, what are you guys in the market for? Weve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards..."
meld_236_2,Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think?
meld_236_3,"Well, I dont have to buy that, ""Im with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
meld_236_4,"Well, I like it. Here you go."
meld_236_5,"All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
meld_236_6,"Oh, I embarrass you?"
meld_236_7,How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
meld_236_9,Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
meld_236_10,Theyre all tourists.
meld_236_11,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
meld_236_12,Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
meld_236_13,Good choice.
meld_236_14,Thanks.
meld_236_15,"Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!"
meld_237_0,"So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?"
meld_237_1,What?
meld_237_2,"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else."
meld_237_3,"And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my"
meld_237_4,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
meld_237_5,You don't even know me...
meld_237_6,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you."
meld_237_7,What?
meld_237_8,"The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this."
meld_237_9,"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe..."
meld_237_10,"No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?"
meld_237_11,Oh yeah.
meld_238_0,"Okay, forward. ForwardStop!  Okay, backStop!  Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop!"
meld_238_1,"Okay, heres what were gonna do."
meld_238_2,"Okay, Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral."
meld_238_3,You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.
meld_238_4,Okay?
meld_238_5,"All right, here we go."
meld_238_6,Haul ass!!!
meld_239_0,"So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain."
meld_239_1,So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
meld_239_2,...and live forever as a machine!
meld_239_3,"That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?"
meld_239_4,"You and I, we're interfacing."
meld_239_5,"Yeah, I gotta go."
meld_239_6,Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
meld_240_0,"David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air."
meld_240_1,"Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion."
meld_240_2,See?
meld_240_3,"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
meld_240_4,"Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
meld_240_5,"Oh, I should go, too."
meld_240_6,"Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there."
meld_241_0,"Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there."
meld_241_1,"And she was like ""Oh, don't worry!"
meld_241_2,I asked him.
meld_241_3,"He's totally ok with seeing you!""."
meld_241_4,So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
meld_241_5,"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
meld_241_6,Exactly!
meld_241_7,And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
meld_241_8,"I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,"
meld_241_9,"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something."
meld_241_10,"Ok, that'll be great!"
meld_241_11,"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."
meld_241_12,That's not what we're gonna do!
meld_241_13,"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?"
meld_242_0,"Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me."
meld_242_1,Hello Skidmark.
meld_242_2,"Its a nickname, Ill explain later."
meld_242_3,Its pretty clear.
meld_242_4,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight."
meld_242_5,Thats why you broke up with me?
meld_242_6,"You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!"
meld_243_0,Ni-chou chi-ma!
meld_243_1,"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
meld_244_0,Hi everyone.
meld_244_1,"I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before."
meld_244_3,"Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey."
meld_244_4,"What did, what did he say?"
meld_244_5,"Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know."
meld_244_6,"So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so."
meld_245_0,"Oh, great!"
meld_245_1,"We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck."
meld_245_2,"Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly."
meld_245_3,"All I could think of was yknow, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"""
meld_245_4,And did he?
meld_245_5,"Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself."
meld_245_6,"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it."
meld_245_7,I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.
meld_245_8,"Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler."
meld_245_9,"Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?"
meld_245_10,You sound like a guy.
meld_245_11,"No, a guy would be saying, ""Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."""
meld_245_12,Oh my God!
meld_245_13,Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
meld_245_14,Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!
meld_245_15,"I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again."
meld_245_16,Youll have a last kiss.
meld_246_0,Thank you so much for coming back over.
meld_246_1,"Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable."
meld_246_2,"I know Mona, just hear me out."
meld_246_3,"First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own."
meld_246_4,Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.
meld_246_5,Focus.
meld_246_6,"Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are"
meld_247_0,All right wheres that turkey!
meld_247_1,Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
meld_247_2,Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
meld_248_0,No.
meld_248_1,No!
meld_248_3,"Oh, would you look at that Monica?"
meld_248_4,"I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad."
meld_248_5,"Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!"
meld_248_6,"Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning."
meld_248_7,Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
meld_249_0,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
meld_249_1,Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
meld_249_2,"Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work."
meld_249_3,But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
meld_249_4,"I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!"
meld_249_5,Or Friday with no two pizzas!
meld_249_6,All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.
meld_249_7,No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
meld_249_8,"All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?"
meld_249_9,Thats right!
meld_249_10,Cause Im a Tribbiani!
meld_249_11,And this is what we do!
meld_249_13,We can eat!
meld_250_0,"Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube."
meld_250_1,Look at this!
meld_250_2,Oh! You have a window!
meld_250_3,Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
meld_250_4,Oh look! That guy's peeing!
meld_250_5,Hi.
meld_250_6,Hi.
meld_251_0,"Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?"
meld_251_1,Okay. Lets use this brush.
meld_251_2,Okay. This stuff?
meld_251_3,Yeah.
meld_251_4,All right.
meld_251_5,"Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it."
meld_251_6,Okay-Dokey
meld_252_0,Where exactly is your zoo?
meld_252_1,"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience."
meld_252_2,"Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?"
meld_252_3,Yes.
meld_252_4,"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?"
meld_252_5,"No-no, he's, he's very docile."
meld_252_6,Even if he were... cornered?
meld_252_7,"Well I, I don't know. Why?"
meld_252_8,"Uh, how is he at handling small objects?"
meld_252_9,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
meld_252_10,"How about a hammer, or a small blade?"
meld_252_13,Otherwise it's just cruel.
meld_252_14,"He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego."
meld_252_15,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..."
meld_252_16,...He's in.
meld_252_17,"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"
meld_252_18,You're making a big mistake here.
meld_252_19,"I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains."
meld_253_0,My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
meld_253_1,Really helped speed the process along!
meld_253_2,Janice!
meld_253_3,You're not... gone?
meld_253_4,Sid is still in his room.
meld_253_5,I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.
meld_253_6,So did you do it?
meld_253_7,Did you make your deposit?
meld_253_8,Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
meld_253_9,"That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?"
meld_253_10,I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
meld_253_11,"Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is."
meld_254_0,"Phoebe, where's your purse?"
meld_254_1,"No, no! Give it to me!"
meld_254_2,You can't have it.
meld_254_3,Give it to me!
meld_254_4,No
meld_254_5,I'll go in there.
meld_254_6,Oh yeah.
meld_254_7,Phoebe come here
meld_254_8,Haha!
meld_254_9,Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
meld_255_0,"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial."
meld_255_1,I just had sex.
meld_255_2,"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
meld_255_3,"Well, you never told me how old you were."
meld_255_4,"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?"
meld_255_5,I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
meld_255_6,Don't say it.
meld_255_7,...in love with you.
meld_255_8,Really?
meld_255_9,Sorry.
meld_255_10,"Well,fall out of it."
meld_255_11,"You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night."
meld_255_12,"Oh god, oh god."
meld_255_13,I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
meld_255_14,I'm Joan Collins.
meld_255_15,Who?
meld_256_0,"Thats right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!"
meld_256_1,"Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here?"
meld_256_2,You. Like you havent done enough.
meld_256_3,"Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do."
meld_256_4,I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
meld_256_5,"Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies."
meld_256_6,"And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea."
meld_256_7,God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
meld_256_8,"Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end"
meld_256_9,"Oh Phoebe, thats a great story."
meld_256_10,Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea?
meld_256_11,"Oh God, get out!"
meld_256_12,Get out!!
meld_256_13,Get out!!
meld_256_14,Get out!
meld_256_15,Lets.
meld_257_0,"All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay."
meld_257_1,Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now?
meld_257_2,I cant watch!
meld_257_3,Oh.
meld_257_4,"Seriously, how can you watch this?"
meld_257_5,Arent you scared?
meld_257_6,Terrified.
meld_258_0,Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
meld_258_1,"Umm, listen there's something I think you should know."
meld_258_2,"Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?"
meld_258_3,"Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine."
meld_258_4,"I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around."
meld_258_5,"Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I"
meld_258_6,Fine! Maybe I will too!
meld_259_0,"Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away."
meld_259_1,You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
meld_259_2,MY SANDWICH?!!!
meld_259_3,MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
meld_260_0,"Whats the matter, Pheebs?"
meld_260_1,She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
meld_260_2,What?!
meld_260_3,"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly."
meld_260_4,"Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is."
meld_260_5,"She knows, and she wont tell me."
meld_260_6,"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!"
meld_260_7,"Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet."
meld_260_8,Where ya going?
meld_260_9,"Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is."
meld_260_10,"Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering."
meld_260_11,"Well, are any of those people here?!"
meld_261_0,"Oh my God, so do I!"
meld_261_1,"I knew it, wow!!"
meld_261_2,"Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?"
meld_261_3,"Ohh, so cute."
meld_261_4,"Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you."
meld_261_5,I know. Im mad at me too.
meld_261_6,"Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry."
meld_261_7,Hey! Me too!
meld_261_8,"All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out."
meld_262_0,"Ok, you can do this."
meld_262_1,It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
meld_262_2,"Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed."
meld_262_3,"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice."
meld_262_4,"All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it."
meld_263_0,Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
meld_263_1,"Really?  My God, hes really cute."
meld_263_2,Go for it.
meld_263_3,"Phoebe, Im engaged!"
meld_263_4,"Im just saying, get his number just in case."
meld_263_5,But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
meld_263_6,"Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged."
meld_263_7,Well you should be embarrassed.
meld_263_8,"I did, but that was really fun."
meld_264_0,Hey.
meld_264_1,Chandler. I sensed it was you.
meld_264_2,What?!
meld_264_3,Unagi. Im always aware.
meld_264_4,"Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?"
meld_264_5,Whats up?
meld_264_6,I cant figure out what to make Monica.
meld_264_7,"Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes."
meld_264_8,Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
meld_264_9,Yknow what?
meld_264_10,Shed-shed love this.
meld_264_11,"Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8."
meld_264_12,I made it in the sixth grade.
meld_264_13,"Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon."
meld_264_14,"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon."
meld_264_15,"But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
meld_264_16,"Wait a minute, I cant give this to her."
meld_264_17,Why not?
meld_264_18,"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom."
meld_265_0,Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
meld_265_1,He might still show up.
meld_265_2,"Oh, what are you, stupid? Its been three hours."
meld_265_3,Is that all?
meld_265_4,"I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?"
meld_266_0,"Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding."
meld_267_0,"Um, its going to be a small ceremony."
meld_268_0,"Uh, tiny!"
meld_268_1,Were not even sure why were having it.
meld_269_0,Its actually going to be just family.
meld_269_1,"Ohwaityou two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing"
meld_270_0,"Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me."
meld_270_1,Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
meld_270_2,"Oh great! What, you brought Joey?"
meld_270_3,"Well, I brought the next best thing."
meld_271_0,Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
meld_271_1,"Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!"
meld_271_2,"Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!"
meld_271_3,You're so sweet!
meld_271_4,"Ohh, you're so sweet!"
meld_271_5,"Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me."
meld_271_6,Huh.
meld_271_7,Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
meld_271_8,Uhh.
meld_271_9,"You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?"
meld_271_10,Nah.
meld_272_0,"How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!"
meld_272_1,Dont you think I asked him that before he got in?!
meld_272_2,"Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!"
meld_272_3,No!
meld_272_4,Do you like car games?
meld_272_5,"Yeah, yknow the license plate game?"
meld_272_6,I
meld_272_7,"Ooh, Ill play! Ill play!"
meld_272_8,No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
meld_273_0,"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?"
meld_273_1,I cant figure this out!
meld_273_2,Its so hard!
meld_273_3,Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah!
meld_273_4,Paper cut!
meld_273_5,"Now, have you told anyone else?"
meld_273_6,"No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out."
meld_273_7,You told me.
meld_273_8,"Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
meld_273_9,"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet."
meld_273_10,Me too.
meld_273_11,Hey.
meld_273_12,Hey.
meld_273_13,"Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?"
meld_273_14,Oh all right.
meld_273_15,"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go."
meld_273_16,"Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place."
meld_273_17,How rude.
meld_273_18,"Oh, Im sorry. You wanna bite?"
meld_274_0,"The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!"
meld_274_1,What?
meld_274_2,The ring is gone!
meld_274_3,Ugh.
meld_274_4,"Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!!"
meld_274_5,You lost the ring!
meld_274_6,Youre the worst best man ever!
meld_274_7,"Dude, this isnt funny!"
meld_274_8,What am I gonna do?!
meld_274_9,"I go to bed last night, everythings cool!"
meld_274_10,"I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is gone!"
meld_274_11,You slept with the stripper?
meld_274_12,Of course!!
meld_275_0,What difference does that make?!
meld_275_1,"Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!"
meld_275_2,"Joey, do you have a minute?"
meld_275_3,"Dude, what am I gonna"
meld_275_4,"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out."
meld_275_5,"Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!"
meld_275_6,"Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place."
meld_275_7,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have"
meld_275_8,"What-what is it, what is it?"
meld_275_9,"Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone."
meld_275_10,"Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!"
meld_275_11,"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!"
meld_275_12,"I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!"
meld_275_13,What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
meld_275_14,And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
meld_275_15,"I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone"
meld_275_16,I'm not listening to you!
meld_276_0,Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!
meld_276_2,"Hey, come on now!"
meld_276_3,"All right, what are we havin?"
meld_277_0,"Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation."
meld_277_1,Ill take those to go.  For the kids.
meld_277_2,"Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?"
meld_277_3,"It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said."
meld_277_4,"But believe me, thats not gonna happen today."
meld_277_5,"Understood. So, whatd you say back then?"
meld_277_6,"Well, I said that I"
meld_278_0,Ha!
meld_278_1,So you like the drums!
meld_278_2,"That's, that's great!"
meld_278_3,"Yknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation."
meld_278_4,"All right, okay, well, apparently not!"
meld_278_5,"So, yay!"
meld_278_6,"Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four..."
meld_278_7,Tequila!!
meld_278_8,That's fun.
meld_279_0,"Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?"
meld_279_1,Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
meld_279_2,Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
meld_279_3,"Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it."
meld_279_4,"Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed."
meld_279_5,"All right thats it, school is in session!"
meld_279_6,My God! Is this a gym card?
meld_279_7,"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times."
meld_279_8,So why dont you quit?
meld_279_9,You dont think Ive tried? You think I
meld_279_10,Who is Maria?
meld_279_11,"Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat."
meld_279_12,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
meld_279_13,No!
meld_279_14,So youre strong enough to face her on your own?
meld_279_15,"Oh no, youll have to come."
meld_280_0,"Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that."
meld_280_1,Exactly! Because it's in the past!
meld_280_2,Anybody gonna eat that?
meld_281_0,Pheebs!
meld_281_1,Hey!
meld_281_2,"Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?"
meld_281_3,Yeah!
meld_281_4,"Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens underwear!"
meld_281_5,I know. They were mine.
meld_281_6,"Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird!"
meld_281_7,"No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on."
meld_281_8,Thats weird!
meld_281_9,Im wearing his briefs right now.
meld_281_10,Thatskinda hot.
meld_282_0,I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
meld_282_1,"Yeah, I wouldnt know about that."
meld_282_2,And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
meld_283_0,"Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!"
meld_283_1,There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you.
meld_283_2,"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys."
meld_283_3,Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear!
meld_283_4,I dont think you could ever do that.
meld_283_5,Hey! I
meld_283_6,"Okay, whatever."
meld_284_0,Lusts of the flesh.
meld_284_1,What?
meld_284_2,I dont know.  A cowboy theme?
meld_285_0,"Hey uh, is it okay to come in?"
meld_285_1,"Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!"
meld_285_2,"Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya."
meld_285_3,Hey!
meld_285_4,Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
meld_285_5,"Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my  breast?"
meld_285_6,"It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don’t worry. It’ll happen."
meld_285_7,Yowza
meld_285_8,"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth."
meld_285_9,Dear Lord.
meld_285_10,"I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?"
meld_285_11,"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…"
meld_285_13,Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?
meld_285_14,She looks scared.
meld_285_15,Doesn’t she  look scared?
meld_285_16,"Y’know, I don’t really know her."
meld_286_0,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
meld_286_1,"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
meld_286_2,"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
meld_286_3,"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the ""a-gogo."""
meld_287_0,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
meld_287_1,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
meld_287_2,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me."
meld_287_3,The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
meld_287_4,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
meld_287_5,Pathetic mess?
meld_287_6,"I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable."
meld_287_7,"I'm thinkin', cha-ching!"
meld_287_8,Thanks.
meld_287_9,"Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice."
meld_287_10,You're doin' this.
meld_287_11,Hi. She said yes.
meld_287_12,"Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?"
meld_288_0,"""Happy birthday to you!"""
meld_288_1,Youre paying for that.
meld_288_2,What? No-no its her birthday!
meld_288_3,Youve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
meld_288_4,But it really
meld_288_5,You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
meld_288_6,Damnit!
meld_288_7,Rach? Hi!
meld_288_8,Hi!
meld_288_9,Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
meld_288_10,Well yeah
meld_288_11,Oh wow!
meld_288_12,"I mean, wow!"
meld_288_13,"I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!"
meld_288_14,Really?!
meld_288_15,"Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!"""
meld_288_16,Oh so-so not really never.
meld_288_17,I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
meld_288_18,"I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate."
meld_288_19,"Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing."
meld_288_20,"Oh-ho, and mine!"
meld_289_1,No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
meld_289_2,WellI only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.
meld_289_3,"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?"
meld_289_4,"Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!"
meld_289_5,Chandler?
meld_290_0,I-Im sorry?
meld_291_0,"No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!"
meld_291_1,Oh yeah?
meld_292_0,I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
meld_292_1,Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk.
meld_292_2,Hang-hang on.
meld_292_3,Hey everybody!
meld_292_4,"Uh, Im gonna kill myself!"
meld_292_5,I got nothing.
meld_293_0,"Apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!"
meld_293_1,I didnt know he could get me fired!
meld_293_2,What am I going to do?
meld_293_3,"Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy."
meld_293_4,"Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here."
meld_293_5,"No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!"
meld_293_6,Thats not a bad idea.
meld_293_7,"Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys."
meld_293_8,"Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs."
meld_293_9,"So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?"
meld_293_10,Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.
meld_293_11,"Yeah, you wish."
meld_293_12,"""You wish."""
meld_294_0,Why are you yelling?
meld_294_1,"Whoa, that"
meld_295_0,"Whoa-whoa, what is it?"
meld_295_1,Well Its a date.
meld_295_2,A date?!
meld_295_3,"No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!"
meld_295_4,"Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this."
meld_295_5,"No, Im gonna!!"
meld_295_6,Thats right!
meld_295_7,"Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin out with that girl!"
meld_295_8,Like-like-like I did something terrible to you!
meld_295_9,"And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing!"
meld_295_10,ThatIts not the same thing! This is
meld_295_11,"Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!"
meld_295_12,She was?
meld_295_13,"Well, she graduated from high school!"
meld_295_14,"Okay, whatever."
meld_295_15,Yknow what?
meld_295_16,"I dont have time to convince you because hes only here for four hours, and Im gonna go see him!"
meld_295_17,Fine!
meld_295_18,Yeah!
meld_295_19,Fine!
meld_295_20,Yeah!
meld_295_21,"What are you still doin here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!"
meld_296_0,"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway."

meld_306_5,"Oh yeah, Id love that."
meld_306_6,"Oh, great! Me too."
meld_306_7,I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.

meld_307_1,Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
meld_307_2,You had fantasies about Emily?

meld_319_7,Wow.
meld_319_8,Theres one thing missing.
meld_319_9,Whats that?
meld_319_10,Its time for me to conquer the physical world.
meld_319_11,Okay.
meld_319_12,"Monica, I want to become  the Ultimate Fighting Champion."
meld_319_13,You wanna what?!
meld_319_14,"I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! Its the most intense physical competition in the world, its banned in 49 states!"
meld_319_15,What are you talking about?
meld_319_16,"Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, Ive even had my own octagon training ring designed."
meld_319_17,And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
meld_319_18,Yeah.
meld_319_19,"Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win."
meld_319_20,I want you close enough to smell the blood.

meld_320_3,What?!
meld_320_4,Im the ruptured spleen.
meld_320_5,Why would you do that?
meld_320_6,Because you shouldnt be with him.  You should be with me.
meld_320_7,Really?
meld_320_8,"When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!"
meld_320_9,"Look, things like last night they dont just happen."
meld_320_10,Or at least not to me.
meld_320_11,"Or with the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and I couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknow with a friend."
meld_320_12,Chandler!
meld_320_13,"I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I guess Im not technically a ""doctor"""
meld_320_14,"There was just one woman, wasnt there?"
meld_320_15,"No, there were two."
meld_320_16,Including me?

meld_324_0,Im your mother.

meld_324_2,"Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler..."
meld_324_3,Hi there.
meld_324_4,"...and he couldnt let it go, and... I dont really know what happened with that either."
meld_324_5,"And then Rosss new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head."
meld_324_6,"And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there either..."
meld_324_7,"Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler."

meld_336_16,"Thats when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies. So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight."
meld_336_17,I am selling cookies by the case.
meld_336_18,They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'

meld_337_9,"Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said"
meld_337_10,"Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check."
meld_337_11,"And then you said, ""Why do they call it a check?"
meld_337_12,"Why not a Yugoslavian?"""
meld_337_13,"Yeah, then you did that."
meld_337_14,So you dont have the cameras?!

meld_338_12,"Well, were starving, why dont we all go get something to eat?"
meld_338_13,"Oh, yeah, well Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin around the house."
meld_338_14,So We go eat.
meld_338_15,Yes.
meld_338_16,"Youll wear that. Well be eating, and of course, youll be wearing that."

meld_342_7,Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing.
meld_342_8,"Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here."
meld_342_9,"All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card."
meld_342_10,Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care.
meld_342_11,You-you must choose Mr. Bing.

meld_342_15,"Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Rosss points!"
meld_342_16,What?!
meld_342_17,This game is kinda fun.
meld_342_18,You dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you

meld_356_22,This will just be my batch.
meld_357_1,Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?
meld_357_2,Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
meld_357_3,What? Mine arent tinted.
meld_358_0,Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
meld_358_1,I will have one.
meld_358_2,"Okay, Im not gonna have one."
meld_358_3,"No, no, its just my tooth."
meld_358_4,All right Ill have one.
meld_358_5,"So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one."
meld_358_6,"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him."
meld_358_7,See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
meld_358_8,Why? Why cant you go to him?
meld_358_9,"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies."
meld_358_10,"That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse."
meld_358_11,"Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!"
meld_358_12,"Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob."
meld_358_13,And all these people actually died?
meld_358_14,"Yes, while I was in the chair!"
meld_358_15,"Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!"
meld_358_16,"Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist."
meld_358_17,"Its, its, its just ah, a coincidence."
meld_358_18,"Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead."
meld_359_0,Hello?
meld_359_1,Ross.
meld_359_3,It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
meld_359_4,"No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you called."
meld_359_5,"Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else."
meld_359_6,Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
meld_360_0,You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
meld_360_1,"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here."
meld_360_2,"So, let's go."
meld_360_3,"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song."
meld_360_4,"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now."
meld_360_5,"You know, the guys are probably having a great time."
meld_361_0,"Okay, Ive got three of my five."
meld_361_1,"Three of your five, what?"
meld_361_2,Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with.
meld_361_3,Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
meld_361_4,"Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left."
meld_361_5,"All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?"
meld_361_6,"Okay, Elizabeth Hurely...."
meld_361_7,"Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving."
meld_361_8,Susan Sarandon.
meld_361_9,"Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
meld_361_10,And!! Isabella Rosselini.
meld_361_11,"Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around."
meld_361_12,So?
meld_361_13,"So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time."
meld_361_14,"Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini, geography."
meld_362_0,Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out?
meld_362_1,Yknow what I think it is?
meld_362_2,I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave.
meld_362_3,Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
meld_362_4,"Twenty-one hours, youre a hero."
meld_362_5,Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
meld_362_6,"Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room."
meld_362_7,What?
meld_362_8,"Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom."
meld_362_9,My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
meld_363_0,Are they here yet?
meld_363_1,"No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
meld_364_0,Ok.
meld_365_0,Hi.
meld_365_1,May I see your boarding pass?
meld_365_2,"Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
meld_365_3,"Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass."
meld_365_4,"No, I know, but Ihe just went on."
meld_365_5,"He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
meld_365_6,No no no! Federal regulations!
meld_365_7,"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is"
meld_365_8,Alright. What's the message?
meld_365_9,Uh... I don't know.
meld_365_10,"Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you."
meld_365_11,What?
meld_365_12,"It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back."
meld_365_13,": Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about!"
meld_365_14,There's no Rachel!
meld_366_0,"Here's the thing, Janice."
meld_366_1,"You know, I mean, it's like we're different."
meld_366_2,"I'm like the bing, bing, bing."
meld_366_3,"You're like the boom, boom, ... boom."
meld_366_4,Ow!
meld_366_5,"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
meld_366_6,"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back."
meld_366_7,I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
meld_366_8,Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
meld_366_9,"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
meld_366_10,"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la."
meld_366_11,I'm fine.
meld_366_12,All right.
meld_366_13,I'm not fine. Here she comes.
meld_366_14,Wait here. Breathe.
meld_366_15,How do you do that?
meld_366_16,It's like a gift.
meld_366_17,We should always always break up together.
meld_366_18,"Oh, I'd like that."
meld_367_0,You win.
meld_367_1,"Well, what did you have?"
meld_367_2,It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six.
meld_367_3,That my friend is D-Cup.
meld_367_4,"Okay, now much have you won so far?"
meld_367_5,"Uh,  wow, 700."

meld_367_7,Yeah.
meld_367_8,Double it!
meld_367_9,What?
meld_367_10,"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it."
meld_367_11,Really?
meld_367_12,"Hey, I didnt make up the rules."
meld_367_13,"Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card."
meld_367_14,"Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500."
meld_367_15,Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way!
meld_368_0,"Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it."

meld_416_0,"I mean, this is unbelievable."
meld_416_1,"I know. This is really, really huge."
meld_416_2,No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.

meld_420_4,I know but its so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
meld_420_5,What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
meld_420_6,"All good, thanks.  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname thats easier to rhyme?"
meld_420_7,Didnt your dad used to call you Pumpkin?

meld_423_3,"No, he's gone."
meld_423_4,"No no, you don't have to fly back, really."
meld_423_5,What do you mean this might be your only chance?
meld_423_6,Would you stop?
meld_423_7,"I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet."

meld_424_1,Oh yeah! With who?
meld_424_2,You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
meld_424_3,Not her.
meld_424_4,"Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decide between the two of them."
meld_424_5,"Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun."
meld_424_6,"But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown."
meld_424_7,"Yknow shes, well shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes"
meld_424_8,"If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
meld_424_9,"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow?"
meld_424_10,She lives so close.
meld_424_11,"And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny."
meld_424_12,"On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist."
meld_424_14,Hey!
meld_424_15,"Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?"
meld_424_16,Damn!
meld_425_0,Oh heres a whole bunch.
meld_425_1,"Oh, I mean shes gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, ""Oh that poor girl."""
meld_425_2,Then shell have to come back here and live all alone.
meld_425_3,Oh my God!
meld_425_4,What?
meld_425_5,"There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and its positive. Monicas pregnant.  So I guess she wont be totally alone."
meld_426_0,Hi.
meld_426_1,"Listen, Im sorry about that whole thing with Roger."
meld_426_2,"It really wasnt right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think youll really enjoy."
meld_426_3,"Now, this is just a loan."
meld_426_4,Okay?
meld_426_5,"Im gonna, Im gonna want him back."
meld_426_6,So  Im gonna go now.
meld_426_7,"Im sorry, I thought I could do it and I cant!"
meld_427_0,"All right, well why dont I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!"
meld_427_1,"Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey."
meld_428_0,"All right ladies, heres what were gonna do."
meld_428_1,"I-I wanna be with her,  I like her."
meld_428_2,"Oh, thats fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts."
meld_428_3,"Wait, now, what am I doing again?"
meld_428_4,"Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!"
meld_428_5,"Hi, Im Joshua, Im here to pick up Rachel."
meld_428_6,"No-no-no, that not Joshua."
meld_428_7,"What do you want from me, Ive never met the guy."
meld_428_8,"So anyway, Rachel, Im sorry you cant stay,  but the rest of us have a"
meld_429_0,How do I look?
meld_429_1,"Oh, uh, I... don't... care."
meld_429_2,"Ok, now, remember, no trading."
meld_429_3,"You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
meld_429_4,"Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice."
meld_429_5,...And what did you bring?
meld_429_6,She's checking the coats.
meld_429_7,"Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands."
meld_429_8,"Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice."
meld_429_9,Janice?
meld_429_10,Oh.... my.... God.
meld_429_11,"Hey, it's Janice."
meld_430_0,"Well, okay so, I dont have it all worked out quite yet. Just dont say anything to Rachel, please?"
meld_430_1,"Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!"
meld_430_2,"Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!"
meld_430_3,Hey Rach!
meld_430_4,What was that?!
meld_430_5,"Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?"

meld_430_8,No
meld_431_0,Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
meld_431_1,"Uh, okay, Pheebs?"
meld_431_2,Yeah?
meld_431_3,"Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?"
meld_431_4,Yeah?
meld_431_5,"All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!"
meld_431_6,"Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!"
meld_431_7,"Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!"
meld_431_8,"Yeah, all of us! All day!"
meld_431_9,That sucks!
meld_431_10,That's not a trip!
meld_431_11,I just came from the park!
meld_431_12,What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
meld_431_13,"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!"""
meld_431_14,"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea."
meld_431_15,"Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!"
meld_431_16,"Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justy'knowstop it!"
meld_431_17,I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
meld_431_18,"That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth."
meld_431_19,Makes me wanna puke!
meld_432_0,Is she in there?
meld_433_0,"Yeah. Shes putting her down now, thats her."
meld_433_1,Oh its all right.
meld_434_0,Im guess Im just done with the whole dating thing.
meld_434_1,Its one more thing in my life thats suddenly completely different.
meld_434_2,This is hard.
meld_434_3,Yeah I know.
meld_434_4,"On the other hand in um, in about seven months youre gonna have something that youre gonna love more than any guy youve ever gone out with."
meld_434_5,Just wait.
meld_434_6,"Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger."
meld_434_7,You have no idea.
meld_434_8,Thanks sweetie.
meld_434_9,"You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?"
meld_434_10,"Oh no, I think Im gonna go home and eat ten candy bars."
meld_434_11,"Hey, I thought I cheered you up."
meld_434_12,"Oh you did, there are twenty in here."

meld_435_5,"Thats a good question, dad. Thats a good question"
meld_435_6,Congratulations you two!
meld_435_7,Thank youwere so excited
meld_435_8,"And also, congratulations on your wedding."
meld_435_9,WhaWhat?

meld_438_0,Ow!
meld_438_1,"Really?! Well, its just like everyone elses apartment. Its got rooms, walls, and ceilings."
meld_438_2,"Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour."
meld_438_3,Oh my God! Oh my God!
meld_438_4,"Ah well, this is the living room."
meld_438_5,All right. This is the kitchen.

meld_438_12,"So um, who was she?"
meld_438_13,"Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today."
meld_438_14,"Did you like her? And Im just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this."
meld_438_15,"Well, you seem fine."
meld_439_0,"Well, I dont think this, y'know."
meld_439_1,"No, no, no, I wouldnt do you myself, I mean that would be weird."

meld_440_1,"All I have is, is oregano and a"
meld_440_2,"Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man."
meld_440_3,"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."
meld_440_4,Can we just start throwing things in?
meld_440_5,"Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK."
meld_440_6,"Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts."

meld_440_13,"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure..."
meld_441_0,"Mona?  Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?"
meld_441_1,I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
meld_441_2,"Oh, its okay."

meld_441_5,"Ooh, I have something you can wear."
meld_441_6,Here.
meld_441_7,"Oh umm, I-I dont know if I want to wear a womans shirt."
meld_441_8,No-no thats a mans shirt.
meld_441_9,Its awfully pink.
meld_442_0,"Oh, it's perfect!"
meld_442_1,How about you?
meld_442_2,It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
meld_442_3,"All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application."
meld_442_4,We are bad people.
meld_442_5,He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
meld_443_0,Lets get the show on it!
meld_443_1,"Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee."
meld_443_2,"Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and its sooo close."
meld_443_3,Closer than here?
meld_443_4,"Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!  Okay, lets skedaddle."
meld_443_5,"Wait, Im not just gonna drink somebodys old coffee."
meld_443_6,"Okay, your highness."
meld_443_7,"Um, Rachel Im really sorry.  Thats okay, do you wanna get back together?  Yeah, okay.  Did anyone else hear that?!"
meld_444_0,So how did you know I was even here?
meld_444_1,Your mom called me. So is this her?
meld_444_2,"No, this is a loaner."
meld_444_3,I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
meld_444_4,"I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?"
meld_444_5,"Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck."
meld_444_6,"Yeah, they're not so bad."
meld_445_0,"Im sorry I wont be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but Im"
meld_445_1,"I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didnt want him to start yelling at me like I was some 74 Latour."
meld_445_2,Its Lafite. The 74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
meld_445_3,"All right here he comes. Im gonna do this, Im gonna tell him, Im gonna be strong."
meld_445_4,I just called a friend of mine.
meld_445_5,Yeah?

meld_445_12,"Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please."
meld_445_13,Stay calm?!!
meld_445_14,How do you expect me to stay calm?!
meld_445_15,This is unacceptable Rachel!
meld_445_16,And I wanna know why?!!
meld_445_17,Is it because that punk Ross wont marry you?!
meld_445_18,Thats it!
meld_445_19,Is that it?
meld_445_20,"Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods."
meld_446_0,"So, youre like a zillionaire?"
meld_446_1,And youre our age. Youre our age.
meld_446_2,"Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself."
meld_446_3,What like Pete Dakota?
meld_446_4,"Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete."
meld_446_5,"Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago."
meld_446_6,Thats not a state Joe.

meld_446_14,"Okay, Im running out of places I can touch him!"
meld_446_15,"Look, is there something wrong with me?"
meld_446_16,I mean why am I only attracted to guys where theres no future?
meld_446_17,"Either theyre too old, or theyre too young, and then theres Pete whos-whos crazy about me, and whos absolutely perfect for me, and theres like zip going on!"
meld_446_18,"I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?"
meld_446_19,No.
meld_447_0,"Okay, Im gonna go get Frank."
meld_447_1,"So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember?"
meld_447_2,"And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass."
meld_448_0,"Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?"
meld_448_1,You know what else Im not gonna miss?
meld_448_2,"""Im Monica."
meld_448_3,I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
meld_448_4,"Even if people are on it!"""
meld_448_5,"""Hi Im Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Id better wash it and shrink it!"""
meld_448_6,"""Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"""
meld_448_7,Hey! I call her!
meld_448_8,"""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"""
meld_448_9,"""Oh my God, I cant find a boyfriend!"
meld_448_10,"So I guess Ill just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"""
meld_448_11,"Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations."
meld_449_0,"Item J437-A, color: winterberry."
meld_449_1,"Hi umm, listen come here, come in."
meld_449_2,Im so-so sorry about yesterday.
meld_449_3,I-Im really sorry.
meld_449_4,Its just that I
meld_449_5,"Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there."
meld_449_6,You do?
meld_449_7,"Yeah, you still have feelings for me."
meld_449_8,"And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you."
meld_449_9,"And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant."
meld_449_10,"Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be."
meld_449_11,Oh God youre right.
meld_449_12,"Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?"
meld_449_13,No.
meld_450_0,"Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy."
meld_450_1,"Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I dont want to make it savory."
meld_450_2,"Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it."
meld_450_3,Gimme this.
meld_450_4,"Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt resist."
meld_450_5,Brides magazines?
meld_450_6,"Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin."
meld_450_7,"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing."
meld_450_8,"It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes."
meld_450_9,"I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant."
meld_450_10,Right?
meld_450_11,"I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy."
meld_450_12,Oh my God.
meld_450_13,I know.  I need more pie.
meld_450_14,"Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?"
meld_450_15,You didnt break up with that fireman?
meld_450_16,"No, that was my way of telling you."
meld_450_17,"Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints."
meld_450_18,He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
meld_450_19,Wow!
meld_450_20,"Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal."
meld_450_21,"So then, are you going to dump Jason?"
meld_450_22,"Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?"
meld_450_23,So Its really just about the math.
meld_451_0,"Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41."
meld_451_1,"Ok, look! Enough is enough!"
meld_451_2,"No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!"
meld_451_3,"Monica, that was also true an"
meld_451_4,I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
meld_451_5,You knew this about me when you married me!
meld_451_6,You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
meld_451_7,"Well, this is my sickness!"
meld_452_0,"Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster."
meld_452_1,"Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night."
meld_452_2,"Yeah me too, all night."
meld_452_3,Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?
meld_452_4,"Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper."
meld_453_0,I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
meld_453_1,Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker
meld_454_0,"Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone."
meld_454_1,"No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!"
meld_454_2,Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
meld_455_0,So.
meld_455_1,So.
meld_455_2,I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
meld_455_3,"I mean, you know, we've never really talked."
meld_455_4,"I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
meld_455_5,"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you."
meld_455_6,Really? Me?
meld_455_7,"Oh my god, are you kidding?"
meld_455_8,"Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't."
meld_455_9,"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
meld_455_10,Oy.
meld_455_11,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
meld_455_12,"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?"
meld_455_13,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
meld_455_14,"I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later."
meld_455_15,"All right, Julie."
meld_455_16,Bye.
meld_455_17,Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
meld_456_0,"Chandler, I found the perfect ring."
meld_456_1,"Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first."
meld_456_2,"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!"
meld_456_3,What?
meld_456_4,Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
meld_456_5,They put you in jail?
meld_456_6,The little jail between the doors!
meld_456_7,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
meld_456_8,"I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring."
meld_456_9,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
meld_456_10,Maybe it was the guy.
meld_456_11,It was the ring!
meld_457_0,"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
meld_457_1,"Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her."
meld_457_2,"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me."
meld_457_3,"Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment."
meld_457_4,"Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend."
meld_457_5,"Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.."
meld_457_6,"We can, we can go to Aruba!"
meld_457_7,"When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice."
meld_457_8,You would've liked it.
meld_457_9,I had a bra.
meld_457_10,"Hey, Dr. Farber."
meld_457_11,"All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here."
meld_457_12,What?!
meld_457_13,"I'm twelve, I'm not stupid."
meld_458_0,Oh my God! What does
meld_459_0,Oh that's an eye removal machine.
meld_459_1,"All right, I'm outta here!"
meld_459_2,I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
meld_459_3,So were done then!
meld_459_4,"Almost! But first, we gotta start."
meld_459_5,This is a glaucoma test.
meld_459_6,Uh-huh.
meld_459_7,Sit down.
meld_459_8,Okay.
meld_459_9,"But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye."
meld_459_10,What?!
meld_459_11,"A small puff of air, now come on!"
meld_460_0,"Sure, now Im scared."
meld_460_1,"No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay? Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday."
meld_460_2,"Yeah, but I dont wanna die!"
meld_460_3,"No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!"
meld_461_0,"Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert."
meld_461_1,"Oh, hey."
meld_461_2,Hi.
meld_461_3,"Youve have lipstick right here . Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed."
meld_462_0,Hey!
meld_462_1,Hey!
meld_462_3,No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.
meld_462_5,"Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step."
meld_462_6,Youre building a post office?
meld_462_7,"No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max."
meld_462_8,Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
meld_462_9,"Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes."
meld_462_10,Power saw kinda got away from me there.
meld_463_0,Hi!
meld_463_1,Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
meld_463_2,"So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?"
meld_463_3,I cant seem to say goodbye.
meld_463_4,"Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?"
meld_463_5,Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
meld_463_6,It was cheesecake.
meld_463_7,It was fine.
meld_463_8,"It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow!"
meld_463_9,My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
meld_463_10,Yknow what? Forget it!
meld_463_11,Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.
meld_463_12,Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
meld_463_13,"Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois."
meld_464_0,This ones from me.
meld_464_1,Ahh!
meld_464_2,"It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun."
meld_464_3,A scooter!
meld_464_4,Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
meld_464_5,"No! No-no, I love it. Thank you."
meld_464_6,"Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!"
meld_464_7,Okay.
meld_464_8,"Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?"
meld_464_9,For my last birthday you gave me a
meld_464_10,Okay.
meld_464_11,Happy birthday Grandma!
meld_464_12,Its better to be over the hill  then buried under it.
meld_464_13,All our love Monica and Chandler.
meld_464_14,"Thats funny, yeah!"
meld_464_15,No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
meld_464_16,"No, I know! I get it! Its funny!"
meld_464_17,"No, because youre not a grandmother!"
meld_464_18,"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things."
meld_464_19,Thats why its so funny.
meld_464_20,All you had to do was buy the card!
meld_465_0,"Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
meld_465_1,Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
meld_465_2,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
meld_465_3,Sorry. Wrong boobies.
meld_465_4,"Hello, Joey."
meld_465_5,"Oh! ...Hello, dear."
meld_466_0,Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
meld_466_1,"I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
meld_466_2,Really?
meld_466_3,"No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.."
meld_466_4,"Hey, buddy."
meld_466_5,"Oh, that's attractive."
meld_466_6,"Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight."
meld_466_7,"Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?"
meld_466_8,"Oh, ah- the kid has it."
meld_466_9,"The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck."
meld_466_10,"You gotta do it, man."
meld_466_11,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatevercan't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck."
meld_466_12,"Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!"
meld_466_13,Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
meld_466_14,GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
meld_466_15,...Now
meld_467_0,"Oh, look, wish me luck!"
meld_467_1,What for?
meld_467_2,I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.
meld_468_0,"Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. Thats good right?"
meld_468_1,You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
meld_468_2,What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!
meld_468_3,Hi!
meld_468_4,Im so glad you could make it.
meld_468_5,"Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it."
meld_468_6,Try. Theres my little girl.
meld_468_7,Shes still mad.
meld_468_8,Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
meld_468_9,"Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?"
meld_469_0,"Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay."
meld_469_1,"Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself."
meld_470_0,Have you felt Rachels cervix Ross?
meld_471_0,"No, I dont think well be doing that."
meld_471_1,Were not gonna do that.
meld_471_2,"Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare."
meld_471_3,Am I interrupting?
meld_471_4,Uh yes! Thank you.
meld_471_5,Oh. Oh wait no.
meld_471_6,Later.
meld_472_1,"Oh uh, Im sorry."
meld_472_2,No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
meld_473_0,Try feeding her again.
meld_473_1,I already fed her.
meld_473_2,"I know, that’s why I said again!"
meld_473_3,"Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?   That’s just what she wants."
meld_473_4,Hey.
meld_474_0,Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
meld_474_1,"Oh Monica, we are so sorry."
meld_474_2,For what?
meld_474_3,"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower."
meld_474_4,And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
meld_474_5,You al-you already had it?
meld_474_6,"Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave."
meld_474_7,"Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either."
meld_474_8,We ruined everything.
meld_474_9,Ugh
meld_474_10,"Well no, wait a minute, thats not true!"
meld_474_11,"No, what did, that was really sweet."
meld_474_12,And it kinda works out for the best.
meld_474_13,"What do you, what do you mean?"
meld_474_14,"Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!"
meld_474_15,"I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I dont even like!"
meld_474_16,Surprise
meld_474_17,Surprise
meld_474_18,Monica.
meld_475_0,"I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!"
meld_475_1,"Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off."
meld_475_2,Not you guys.
meld_475_3,You got it going on!
meld_475_4,"So, what are we gonna do today?"
meld_475_5,They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
meld_475_6,"Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!"
meld_475_7,I don't think so!
meld_475_8,Why not?
meld_475_9,"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
meld_475_10,I'm not always that bad!
meld_475_11,"Oh,"
meld_475_12,I punched you...?
meld_475_13,And...?
meld_475_14,... Phoebe...?
meld_475_15,... and...?
meld_475_16,I clunked your heads together!
meld_476_0,"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there."
meld_476_1,"Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager."
meld_476_2,Yeah.
meld_476_3,Hey!
meld_476_4,I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.
meld_476_5,What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
meld_476_6,"Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room."
meld_476_7,All right. Did everyone get out okay?
meld_476_8,"Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate."
meld_476_9,Ohh. What is this?
meld_476_10,"No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!"
meld_476_11,"Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!"
meld_477_0,Hey! How long until Petes fight?
meld_477_1,"Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves."
meld_477_2,Hot dog?
meld_477_3,"Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you."
meld_477_4,"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?"
meld_477_5,"I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific."
meld_477_6,"Ohh, thats too bad!"
meld_477_7,"No, I-Im saying I liked her."
meld_477_8,"Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."
meld_477_9,"Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again."
meld_477_10,"Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?"
meld_477_11,Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
meld_477_12,"Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry."
meld_477_13,"Hey, the fights starting!"
meld_477_14,"Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?"
meld_477_15,Nine times!
meld_477_16,"Okay, I had to put on lotion!"
meld_477_17,"But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free."
meld_477_18,Fights over!
meld_478_0,"Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?"
meld_478_1,"Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before."
meld_478_2,Hi guys!
meld_478_3,Hey!
meld_478_4,What are you up too?
meld_478_5,"Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites."
meld_478_6,"Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you."
meld_478_7,"Yeah, Big Brother."
meld_478_8,Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
meld_478_9,"Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
meld_478_10,Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
meld_478_11,Eh
meld_478_12,Okay well thats good to know.
meld_478_13,The Mr. Bowmonts here!!!
meld_479_0,"Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business."
meld_479_1,Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie.
meld_479_2,My friends name is Joey.
meld_479_3,Apparently Howies editing now.
meld_479_4,"Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie."
meld_479_5,Can you believe that?!
meld_479_6,Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
meld_479_7,"Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie."
meld_479_8,"No, no ""How you doing?"" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!"
meld_479_9,The nerve huh?
meld_479_10,Yeah!
meld_479_11,Refill?
meld_480_0,Hey! How you doing?
meld_480_1,"Good! Good, long time no see."
meld_480_2,Like your sweater.
meld_480_3,"Oh hey, right back at ya."

meld_480_5,"Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady?"
meld_480_6,So whose is it?
meld_480_7,"Umm, I dont some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later."
meld_480_8,Okay.
meld_480_9,He is so weird.
meld_481_0,You wanna fool around with Joey?
meld_481_1,Yeah!
meld_481_2,"You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!"
meld_481_3,"And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!"
meld_481_4,Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
meld_481_5,"Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet."
meld_481_6,"Who, who are they?"
meld_481_7,I know them from work.
meld_481_8,Both of them?
meld_481_9,"No, one of them..."
meld_481_10,Which one?
meld_481_11,"I don't know, what were the names I just said?"
meld_481_12,"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
meld_481_13,"All right, all right, you're right"
meld_481_14,What the hell are you cooking!
meld_482_0,Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
meld_482_1,"Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?"
meld_482_2,We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
meld_482_3,Thats not mine.
meld_482_4,Yes it is.
meld_482_5,How do you know?
meld_482_6,"The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, ""Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."""
meld_482_7,"Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!"
meld_482_8,"Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them."
meld_482_9,Fine!  But please God.. tell me how to stop them from going off!
meld_482_10,Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.
meld_482_11,Theres a reset button?!
meld_482_12,My God!
meld_482_13,Why didnt I see that!
meld_482_14,"Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?"
meld_482_15,Oh here it is!
meld_482_16,Oh!
meld_482_17,"Ohh, God!"
meld_483_0,"Four letters: ""Circle or hoop""."
meld_483_1,"Ring dammit, ring!"
meld_483_2,Thanks.
meld_483_3,"Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
meld_483_4,What?!
meld_483_5,"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
meld_483_6,"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
meld_483_7,Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
meld_483_8,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
meld_483_9,Nngghhh!!!!!!!
meld_483_10,"Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please."
meld_483_11,"""Heating device."""
meld_483_12,Radiator.
meld_483_13,Five letters.
meld_483_14,Rdtor.
meld_483_15,"Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman."
meld_484_0,"Well, you'll have to wait your turn."
meld_484_1,"Well, how long do you think it'll be?"
meld_484_2,Any minute now.
meld_485_0,"Hey, this-  Heyy..."
meld_486_0,Hey.
meld_486_1,Hey! Any good mail?
meld_486_2,"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild."
meld_486_3,"Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda."
meld_486_4,"""Benefits lapsed."""
meld_486_5,Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
meld_486_6,"Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year."
meld_486_7,Let me see that!
meld_486_8,All right.
meld_486_9,"Oh, I cant believe this!"
meld_486_10,This sucks!
meld_486_11,"When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow?"
meld_486_12,And it wouldnt matter.
meld_486_13,Now I gotta be careful?
meld_486_14,"Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire."
meld_486_15,"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent."
meld_486_16,"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
meld_486_17,look both ways before you cross the street.
meld_487_0,I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
meld_488_0,"I know, it's beautiful. Amazing."
meld_488_1,"I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."
meld_488_2,Do you know anything about women?
meld_488_3,No.
meld_488_4,That's all right.
meld_488_5,Okay.
meld_489_0,Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
meld_489_1,Yeah. He could row like a viking.
meld_489_2,Hi.
meld_489_3,Mmm.
meld_489_4,So how'd it go?
meld_490_0,"Oh, y'know.."
meld_491_0,Did he mention us?
meld_491_1,He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
meld_491_2,"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere."
meld_492_0,...love you.
meld_492_1,Are you're hands still wet?
meld_492_2,"Uh, moist, yeah."
meld_492_3,Let's dry 'em again.
meld_493_0,Oh my God! Oh my God!!
meld_493_1,Still crying?
meld_493_2,Like a
meld_493_3,"Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex."
meld_493_4,Whats the other one?
meld_493_5,"I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one."
meld_493_6,"Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking."
meld_493_7,Oh thats right.
meld_493_8,Youre the talker.
meld_493_9,"Anyway uh, great idea!"
meld_493_10,"Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues."
meld_493_11,"Oh, we have some"
meld_493_12,No you dont!
meld_494_0,"Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up."
meld_495_0,"Yeah, what town are we near?"
meld_495_1,"Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?"
meld_495_2,Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on?
meld_496_0,"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
meld_496_1,"Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?"
meld_496_2,"I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here."
meld_496_3,"Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?"
meld_496_4,Okay!
meld_496_5,"Yeah, no they dont do that."
meld_496_6,"Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us."
meld_496_7,Who?
meld_496_8,I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
meld_496_9,"I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up."
meld_496_10,"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!"
meld_496_11,But if...
meld_496_12,"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else."
meld_496_13,"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back."
meld_496_14,So the going for help went well?
meld_497_0,"Im telling you man, I saw it."
meld_497_1,"Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong."
meld_497_2,"Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh?"
meld_498_0,I know.
meld_498_1,Lets try a lookof far offwonderment.
meld_498_2,"Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come."
meld_498_3,Chandler!
meld_498_4,What is the matter with your face?!
meld_498_5,"I mean this picture is supposed to say ""Geller and Bing to be married,"" not ""Local woman saves drowning moron!"""
meld_498_6,Hey!
meld_498_7,Dont laugh at him!
meld_498_8,Hes
meld_499_0,Were gonna find love!
meld_499_1,Definitely!
meld_499_2,"Yeah, Im pretty confident about that."
meld_499_3,Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
meld_499_4,It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
meld_499_5,What do you mean?
meld_499_6,"Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other."
meld_499_7,You mean a backup?
meld_499_8,Exactly!
meld_499_9,"Yeah, yeah I got that."
meld_499_10,You do?
meld_499_11,Hm-mmm
meld_499_12,Who?
meld_499_15,Yeah!
meld_499_16,Are you serious?!
meld_499_17,"Yeah, I locked him years ago!"
meld_499_18,"Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey."
meld_499_19,"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal."
meld_499_20,"Oh, seriously?"
meld_499_21,"Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?"
meld_500_0,"Yeah, Im sorry man.  You wanna go watch?"
meld_500_1,Yeah!
meld_501_0,Good morning.
meld_501_1,"Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?"
meld_501_2,Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
meld_501_3,Ohh thats nice.
meld_501_4,Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
meld_501_5,Wo-women? You mean like old women?
meld_501_6,"Well kinda old, like 30."
meld_501_7,Oh.
meld_501_8,"And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night."
meld_501_9,"Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some stuff huh?"
meld_501_10,A little.
meld_501_11,Yeah?
meld_501_12,How you doin?
meld_502_0,"Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!"
meld_502_1,I know.
meld_502_2,So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
meld_503_0,What did you just say?
meld_503_1,You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
meld_503_2,Are you serious?!
meld_503_3,Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
meld_503_4,I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
meld_503_5,"Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!"
meld_503_6,What do you say?
meld_503_7,Okay!
meld_503_8,Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
meld_503_9,Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
meld_503_10,It went under the table.
meld_503_11,"Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!"
meld_503_12,Here it is! Here it is!
meld_503_13,That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
meld_503_14,It's a four.
meld_503_15,I think so too.
meld_504_0,Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.
meld_504_1,"Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you."
meld_504_2,"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now."
meld_504_3,Is there anything we can do for you?
meld_504_4,"No just, nobody press on my stomach."
meld_504_5,You can keep those pants by the way.
meld_504_6,Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
meld_504_7,"Yeah, you want some?"
meld_504_8,"Ah, just cut me a little sliver."
meld_504_9,A little bigger.
meld_504_10,Little bigger.
meld_504_11,What?!
meld_504_12,Are you afraid youre gonna run out?!
meld_504_13,Cut me a real piece!
meld_505_0,"Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?"
meld_505_1,"I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler."
meld_505_2,Oh my God!
meld_505_3,"Of course, of course."
meld_505_4,"Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?"
meld_505_5,"Umm, do you know each others hometowns?"
meld_505_6,Why dont you   Wh-whats going on?
meld_505_7,"Well, umm, not much."
meld_505_8,"But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow?"
meld_505_9,"So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?"
meld_505_10,"Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?"
meld_505_11,Nothing..Why?
meld_505_12,"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!"
meld_505_13,Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
meld_505_14,Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
meld_505_15,"Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?"
meld_506_0,"Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this."
meld_506_1,"Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you."
meld_506_2,"Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart."
meld_506_3,"Your good heart Rach,  and, and...."
meld_506_4,No.
meld_506_5,"I cant, youre a totally different person to me now."
meld_506_6,"I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever."
meld_506_7,"God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross."
meld_506_8,"Its just changed, everything."
meld_506_9,Forever.
meld_506_10,"Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean."
meld_506_11,Then how come it is?
meld_507_0,"Windows are clean, candels are lit."
meld_507_1,"Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt."
meld_507_2,Did I turn the fish?
meld_507_3,"No, cause I made lasagne."
meld_507_4,Am I out of control?
meld_507_5,Just a touch.
meld_507_6,"Mon, I don't understand."
meld_507_7,"I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?"
meld_507_8,"I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
meld_507_9,What?
meld_507_10,Could tonight be the Night?
meld_507_11,I don't know.
meld_507_12,Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.
meld_507_13,"Things happen, and they happen."
meld_507_14,You don't plan these things.
meld_507_15,"So, did you shave your legs?"
meld_507_16,Yeah.
meld_508_0,Ross!
meld_508_2,"Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up."
meld_508_3,Hi!
meld_508_4,"Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready."
meld_508_5,Uh-oh.
meld_508_6,Is there a problem?
meld_508_7,"Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato."
meld_508_8,"But that's okay, no problem."
meld_508_9,No problem.
meld_508_10,"Hmm, noodle soup."
meld_508_11,"Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, ""Hmm, soup."""
meld_508_12,"Oh, what did I say?"
meld_508_13,"Hmm, noodle soup."
meld_508_14,How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!
meld_508_15,"All right, let's try one."
meld_508_16,"Hmm, noodle soup."
meld_508_17,Okay. Let's do it again.

meld_509_0,Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
meld_509_1,Yeah?
meld_509_2,Give her some money.
meld_509_3,I really think theyre out of rooms.
meld_509_4,"Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!"
meld_509_5,"Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are."
meld_509_6,Okay.
meld_509_7,"Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?"
meld_509_8,This is a hospital.
meld_509_9,Yknow what?
meld_509_10,Id have to say I really dont care for your tone.
meld_509_11,And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa!
meld_509_12,Oh gosh!
meld_509_13,What-what?
meld_509_14,Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
meld_509_15,Would you like to see a semi-private room?
meld_509_16,"Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look."
meld_510_0,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
meld_510_1,That's funny. Who are they?
meld_510_2,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend."
meld_510_3,You mean they're lovers.
meld_510_4,If you wanna put a label on it.
meld_510_5,"Wow, uh, anything else I should know?"
meld_511_0,"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this."
meld_511_1,"Okay, quick and painful."
meld_511_2,"Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me."
meld_511_3,"Oh, what? What-what?"
meld_511_4,Y'know Marcel?
meld_511_5,...Yeah?

meld_512_3,Good.
meld_512_4,"Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?"
meld_512_5,Yeah.
meld_512_6,And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
meld_512_7,Yeah!
meld_512_8,And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
meld_512_9,"Ooh, now you lost me."
meld_512_10,You stole the phone!
meld_512_11,No I didnt!
meld_512_12,"No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?"
meld_512_13,"No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!"
meld_512_14,Phoebe!
meld_513_0,Its not here.
meld_513_1,"Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?"
meld_513_2,How could I have left them in the copy room?
meld_513_3,I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? Its not a perfect world! Just go please.
meld_513_4,Fine.
meld_514_0,How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
meld_514_1,This will be your phone.
meld_514_2,"That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls."
meld_514_3,No you answer it and take pledges.
meld_514_4,But I'm the host!
meld_514_5,"No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones."
meld_514_6,"You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray."
meld_514_7,"Well, here's your phone doctor."
meld_515_0,Hey guys.
meld_515_1,Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
meld_515_2,"Well, hes very charming."
meld_515_3,"I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him."
meld_515_4,"Well, youre just gonna have to try."
meld_515_5,"Joey, where are the"
meld_515_6,"I dont know, Chandler is supposed to be passin em around..."
meld_516_0,"Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go."

meld_516_2,Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break?
meld_516_3,My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
meld_516_4,I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband.
meld_516_5,"Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots."
meld_517_0,Come on more!
meld_517_1,Oh God!
meld_517_2,"Yeah, you like that dont you?"
meld_517_3,Oh yeah right there!
meld_517_4,You want it there? You take it there baby!
meld_517_5,Uh Phoebe?
meld_517_6,"Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now Im going to cover you back up, and umm were never doing this again."
meld_518_0,Happy?! Is that what Im supposed to be Vic? Happy?
meld_518_1,"Well, why dont you tell me what youre supposed to be!"
meld_518_2,Huh?
meld_518_3,Because I sure as hell cant figure it out!
meld_518_4,I talk to you and its nothin.
meld_518_5,"You look at me, and nothin."
meld_518_6,Nothing.
meld_518_7,"You guys make me fly! High! Okay, were gonna pick it up here, tomorrow."
meld_518_8,"Well, that was ah..."
meld_519_0,What?! What are you doing?!
meld_519_1,Do you know what just happened?
meld_519_2,Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
meld_519_3,No. We were in the middle of sexand
meld_519_4,"Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!"
meld_520_0,"Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States."
meld_520_1,Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
meld_520_2,"Phoebe, why is your bag moving?"
meld_520_3,"Oh, it's not!"
meld_520_4,"Seriously, it's moving!"
meld_520_5,What the hell is in there?
meld_520_6,It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
meld_521_0,There will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
meld_521_1,"I had such an opportunity in the recent, present."
meld_521_2,"And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually."
meld_521_3,"Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him."
meld_521_4,"And now, hes got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV."
meld_521_5,"Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry."
meld_521_6,Thank you.
meld_522_0,Rach?
meld_522_1,Ill be out in a second.

meld_522_6,"Please, dont play the music. Just uh one more."
meld_523_0,I can't believe you don't want to know.
meld_523_1,"I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows...."
meld_523_2,And Monica knows...
meld_523_3,"Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"

meld_524_10,"Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back."
meld_524_11,"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
meld_524_12,Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
meld_524_13,"So, what happens to the old guys?"
meld_524_14,"Well, they go into the chipper."
meld_524_15,"Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!"
meld_524_16,Hey! Hey!!
meld_525_0,Light still out?
meld_525_1,Yeah.
meld_525_2,Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
meld_525_3,"Oh please, they're having sex."

meld_525_5,"So, whaddya think George is like?"
meld_525_6,I think he's shy.
meld_525_7,Yeah?
meld_525_8,Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
meld_526_0,"Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Im a big, big fan of yours. I mean,"
meld_526_1,Arent you with that girl over there?
meld_526_2,"Well, yeah, kinda."
meld_526_3,"Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so Im allowed to sleep with you."
meld_526_4,"No, no, no, its flattery."
meld_526_5,"Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella."
meld_526_6,"Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast."
meld_526_7,I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
meld_526_8,"Yeah, for you. Is that the list?"
meld_526_9,"Um, yeah."
meld_526_10,May I see it?
meld_526_11,"Um, no."
meld_526_12,Come on!
meld_526_13,"But, okay."
meld_526_14,Im not on the list!
meld_526_15,"Um, see, but thats not the final draft."
meld_526_16,Its laminated!
meld_526_17,"Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local."
meld_526_18,Y'know its ironic...
meld_526_19,...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
meld_526_20,Were just gonna be friends.
meld_527_0,Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get!
meld_527_1,Hey Pheebs!
meld_527_2,Ohh! You made up!
meld_527_3,"Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long."
meld_527_4,"Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love."
meld_527_5,"Ohh, get a room."
meld_527_6,We have one.
meld_527_7,I know. Use it.
meld_528_0,"Oh Mon, listen I have to ask!"
meld_528_1,"Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?"
meld_528_2,"Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!"
meld_528_3,"Ohh! And Im one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!"
meld_528_4,"Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married?"
meld_528_5,Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break!
meld_529_0,Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
meld_529_1,So thats the only reason she could be here huh?
meld_529_2,It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a
meld_529_3,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!"
meld_529_4,"I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later."
meld_529_5,Good-bye.
meld_529_6,Whoa!
meld_529_7,"Uh, that was your sister actually."
meld_529_8,She-she thinks that youre just using me.
meld_529_9,So?
meld_530_0,Im sorry.
meld_530_1,What are you doing here?!
meld_530_2,"I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays."
meld_530_3,What?!
meld_530_4,"Umm, okay, okay, look."
meld_530_5,I took this picture from your fridge.
meld_530_6,"Okay, because I know that this is my Father."
meld_530_7,"Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him."
meld_530_8,"Now, look I deserve to know where I came from."
meld_530_9,All right?
meld_530_10,So if you can help me find my Father then you should!
meld_530_11,"Otherwise, youre just mean!"
meld_530_12,"So, just tell me the truth!"
meld_530_13,"All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni."
meld_530_14,My Father is Chuck Magioni?
meld_530_15,"No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!"
meld_530_16,"And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth."
meld_530_17,Oh.
meld_530_18,"But umm, youre right."
meld_530_19,I think that a person should know where they come from.
meld_530_20,"Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay."
meld_530_21,Im your mother.
meld_530_22,Heh?
meld_530_23,"Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and..."
meld_531_0,Whats happening to your accent?
meld_531_1,Come again?
meld_531_2,Whats-whats this nonsense?
meld_531_3,"All right, Im-Im not English."
meld_531_4,Im from Long Island.
meld_531_5,"I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out."
meld_531_6,Im sorry.
meld_531_7,"So, if we could just get back to the lecture."
meld_531_8,"Umm, were there any questions?"
meld_531_9,About paleontology.
meld_531_10,"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression."
meld_531_11,"Obviously, I screwed up."
meld_531_12,But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here.
meld_531_13,So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
meld_531_14,Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am
meld_531_15,"Well, hello Rachel!"
meld_532_0,"Where you going, Joe?"
meld_532_1,For a walk.
meld_532_2,Oh. You mind if I join you?
meld_532_3,"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts."
meld_532_4,Your thoughts? Plural?
meld_532_5,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!"
meld_532_6,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
meld_532_7,Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??
meld_532_8,You guys are killing me!
meld_532_9,She's forbidden fruit!
meld_532_10,"It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?"
meld_532_11,Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
meld_532_12,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
meld_532_13,Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
meld_532_14,Great novels?
meld_532_15,Fine ... mediocre porn
meld_533_0,"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office."
meld_533_1,"Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk."
meld_533_2,Thats kinda sad.
meld_533_3,"Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,"
meld_533_4,Got it!
meld_533_5,Lets roll!
meld_533_6,"Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?"
meld_533_7,"Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan."
meld_533_8,"Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you."
meld_533_9,"Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?"
meld_534_0,"Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?"
meld_534_1,Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
meld_534_2,Oh! No problem! I
meld_534_3,What?
meld_535_0,You are iron.
meld_535_1,You are steel!
meld_535_2,"Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?"
meld_535_3,"I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?"
meld_536_0,"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!"
meld_536_1,"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
meld_536_2,"Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school."
meld_536_3,"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket."
meld_536_4,I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
meld_536_5,They had to have that specially made?!
meld_536_6,It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
meld_536_7,"Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!"
meld_536_8,"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out."
meld_536_9,And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
meld_536_10,I-I owe her this.
meld_536_11,I never let her eat.
meld_536_12,"Oh, you go out with him."
meld_536_13,"Oh, really?!"
meld_536_14,"Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?"
meld_536_15,Ill try.
meld_537_0,"Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with."
meld_537_1,"Yeah, yeah, okay."
meld_537_2,"Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I was wondering if.."
meld_537_3,"Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, shes real, uh, mellow!"
meld_537_4,"Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know"
meld_538_0,"Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you."
meld_538_1,Yeah but
meld_538_2,"Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind."
meld_538_3,Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin!
meld_538_4,"Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie!"
meld_538_5,"Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets!"
meld_538_6,"Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?"
meld_538_7,Sure!
meld_538_8,He got it a flea market!
meld_538_9,"You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little."
meld_539_0,And Joey?
meld_539_1,How do you think she's doing?
meld_539_2,Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
meld_539_3,"Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ...."
meld_539_4,Thank you!
meld_539_5,Now that Rachel's gone?
meld_539_6,So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.

meld_540_1,What?
meld_540_2,Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
meld_540_3,"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me."
meld_540_5,"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?"
meld_541_0,"So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there."
meld_541_1,Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
meld_541_2,"Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little."
meld_541_3,What do you mean?
meld_541_4,Carol our sex life isits just not working

meld_541_9,Yay!
meld_541_10,Yay!
meld_541_11,"Seriously, our sex life I was thinking, maybe I dont know, we could try some-some new things."
meld_541_12,For fun?
meld_541_13,Like what?
meld_541_14,"Well I dont know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?"
meld_541_15,"Umm, some people eat stuff off one another."
meld_541_16,Nah!
meld_541_17,"Umm, yknow we-we could try dirty talk?"
meld_541_18,"Umm, we could, we could have a threesome."
meld_541_19,I love that idea!
meld_542_0,So whos idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
meld_542_1,"Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box."
meld_542_2,"Oh my God, they took my idea!"
meld_542_3,That was you?!
meld_542_4,"Yeah! Okay, here you go."
meld_542_5,"Rachel, I made you a cocoa."
meld_542_6,"Oh my God, are you guys okay?"
meld_542_7,Are you all right?
meld_542_8,Oh my.

meld_545_0,"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!"
meld_545_1,"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions."
meld_545_2,Why would we do that?
meld_545_3,"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died."
meld_545_4,"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
meld_545_5,"Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!"
meld_545_6,The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.

meld_545_9,"I can't, I gotta go."

meld_546_12,"Okay, I'm not getting this!"
meld_546_13,I'm totally getting it!
meld_546_14,Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
meld_546_15,What? You just click when they click.
meld_546_16,"Alright people, now everyone grab a partner."
meld_546_17,"Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel."

meld_547_2,"Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here..."
meld_548_0,"Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day."

meld_548_5,Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
meld_548_6,"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion."
meld_548_7,Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
meld_548_10,"Walls are pretty thin, guys!"
meld_549_0,"Hi uh, Im Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect Id like to donate some fluids."
meld_549_1,"Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so were not looking for applicants right now."
meld_549_2,"Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in?"
meld_549_3,"Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up."
meld_549_4,Thanks.  Well but this one starts now.
meld_549_5,"Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. Its a twins study."
meld_549_6,"But its $2,000."
meld_549_7,Sorry.
meld_549_8,Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
meld_549_9,"We already got the results back on that on, and theyre not good."
meld_550_0,Hey! Hows it goin?
meld_551_0,"Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes."
meld_551_1,Yes it has! I made cookies!
meld_551_2,Oh thats all right. Im still full from your homemade potato chips.
meld_551_3,But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven.
meld_551_4,Okay.
meld_551_5,"Oh-ho! But not in here! Cant eat em in bed, remember? No crumbies!"
meld_551_6,"Okay, Ill be out in a second."
meld_551_7,Okay!
meld_551_8,What are you doing?
meld_551_9,That doesnt lock does it?
meld_552_0,"You know, it still smells like monkey in there."
meld_552_1,That saves us a conversation.
meld_552_2,"Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped."
meld_552_3,"Me too, we should get goin'."
meld_552_4,No.
meld_553_0,"Okay, here comes another camera."
meld_553_1,Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
meld_553_2,Why do they keep doing that?
meld_553_3,"If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms."
meld_553_4,Theyve been taping those people up there all day.
meld_553_5,Right.
meld_553_6,"Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?"
meld_553_7,Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?

meld_553_9,Hey! Youre a good dancer!
meld_553_10,Really?
meld_553_11,"Yeah, well youd be better if you just loosened your hips a little."
meld_553_12,What do you mean?
meld_553_13,Like this.
meld_553_14,"Thats it, feel the rhythm. Thats better."
meld_553_15,Uh-huh.
meld_553_16,"Okay, youre dancing with that girl over there."
meld_553_17,No-no-no-no-no we came together!
meld_553_18,"I dont see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!"
meld_553_19,"No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot."
meld_553_20,"Really, ythink so? I dont.."

meld_557_0,"Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this."
meld_557_1,"Ah, mustve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store."
meld_557_2,"Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description."
meld_557_3,Oh.
meld_557_4,Oh uhI actually came here to ask you out.
meld_557_5,"Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. Im just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend"

meld_558_1,"Well, like father, like son."
meld_558_2,Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
meld_558_3,Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
meld_558_4,"Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?"
meld_558_5,"Ummmmmmmm, no."
meld_558_6,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!
meld_558_8,"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea."
meld_559_0,"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
meld_559_1,"Oh, yeah. Had that dream."
meld_559_2,"Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there."
meld_559_3,Instead of...?
meld_559_4,That's right.
meld_559_5,Never had that dream.
meld_559_6,No.
meld_559_7,"All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring."
meld_560_0,Honey! Dinners ready!
meld_560_1,Whats my little chef got for me tonight?

meld_560_6,"Okay, in we go."
meld_560_7,Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!  How you doin?
meld_561_0,"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate."
meld_561_1,"So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is."
meld_561_2,"Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?"
meld_561_3,Oh my god.
meld_561_4,What?
meld_561_5,Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
meld_561_6,"Come on, they're close."
meld_561_7,Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
meld_561_8,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
meld_561_9,"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?"
meld_561_10,"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
meld_561_11,"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
meld_561_12,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
meld_561_13,Oh!
meld_561_14,Ow!
meld_561_15,I'm outta here.
meld_561_16,"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
meld_561_17,Really?
meld_561_18,"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up."
meld_562_0,Hello! One marriage please!
meld_562_1,"Yep, we wanna get married!"
meld_562_2,All right.
meld_562_3,Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
meld_562_4,What are you doing?
meld_562_5,"Oh, that's"
meld_562_6,"No, only because that's the graduation song."
meld_562_7,Okay!  This is it!  We're gonna get married!
meld_562_8,Are you sure you wanna do this?
meld_562_9,"Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!"
meld_562_10,"Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!"
meld_562_11,Wait!  Okay!
meld_563_0,Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
meld_563_1,It depends on who asked.
meld_563_2,What if I asked?
meld_563_3,"Oh, Mon, sure."
meld_563_4,Really?
meld_563_5,Yes.  Youre not asking are you?
meld_563_6,No.
meld_563_7,Yes! Totally!
meld_563_8,Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
meld_564_0,"Youarenot going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?"
meld_564_1,He asked you out?!
meld_564_2,No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
meld_564_3,Saucy!
meld_564_4,What are these?
meld_564_5,Electrical plans for the building.
meld_564_6,"Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?"
meld_564_7,"I know that switch does something, okay?"
meld_564_8,So-so I went down to city hall and got these.
meld_564_9,All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
meld_564_10,Wow! If only more people knew.
meld_565_0,Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in
meld_565_1,Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
meld_565_2,"So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me."
meld_565_3,"Oh, nobody's judging you."
meld_565_4,"Oh! Okay!  You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!"
meld_566_0,Oh man!
meld_566_1,I want that place so much!!

meld_568_2,Bye!
meld_568_3,Bye!
meld_568_4,Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.
meld_568_5,"Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!"
meld_568_6,"Actually, I did!"
meld_568_7,"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
meld_568_8,"Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!"
meld_568_9,Are you serious?
meld_568_10,Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
meld_568_11,Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows!
meld_569_0,"Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out."
meld_569_1,"All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off."
meld_569_2,"No, let's just leave the lights on."
meld_569_3,Oh my God!
meld_570_0,"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?"
meld_570_1,Oh fine.

meld_570_3,"Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks."
meld_571_0,"All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area."
meld_571_1,"Can we please focus here, a naked mans life hangs in the balance!"
meld_571_2,Im telling you hes dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
meld_571_3,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, lets poke."
meld_571_4,Steady.
meld_571_5,Steady.
meld_571_6,"Okay, a little higher."

meld_571_9,Thread the needle.
meld_571_10,Hes alive! Hes a-live!!!
meld_571_11,"And yet, were still poking him."
meld_571_12,"Okay, retract the device, retract the device."
meld_571_13,He does not look happy.
meld_571_14,"Hey-hey, now hes showing us his poking device."
meld_571_15,"Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!"
meld_572_0,"Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other."
meld_572_1,"Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard."
meld_572_2,Oh God oh!

meld_572_10,Shes in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
meld_572_11,"Umm. Umm, Im-Im just gonna"
meld_572_12,See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
meld_572_13,"No-no, ImIm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy."
meld_572_14,You miss your girlfriend?
meld_572_15,Just ignore them.
meld_572_16,Ross.
meld_572_17,What? What?
meld_572_18,Hes looking at me.
meld_572_19,Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!

meld_573_8,Its not something you are! Its something you have!
meld_573_9,Say it!
meld_573_10,"Yknow what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!"
meld_574_0,"Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine."
meld_574_1,"Yeah, it's in there."
meld_574_2,Oh! Ohh! Oh!!

meld_574_7,You?!  And-and you?!
meld_574_8,"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
meld_574_9,How?! When?!
meld_574_10,It happened in London.
meld_574_11,IN LONDON!!!
meld_574_12,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
meld_574_13,But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
meld_574_14,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
meld_574_15,"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell."
meld_574_16,"All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's"
meld_574_17,"I know, it's great!"
meld_574_18,"Aww, I don't want to see that!"
meld_574_19,We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
meld_575_0,"And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb."
meld_575_1,"Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?"
meld_575_2,"No Cobb, as in cobb salad."
meld_575_3,"Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?"
meld_576_0,What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
meld_576_1,"Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns."
meld_576_2,"Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?"
meld_576_3,You got a better idea?
meld_576_4,"All right, call it in the air."
meld_576_5,Heads.
meld_576_6,Heads it is.
meld_576_7,Yes! Whew!
meld_576_8,We have to assign heads to something.
meld_576_9,"Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads."
meld_576_10,What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
meld_577_0,"Okay, some tricks of the trade."
meld_577_1,"Now, Ive never been able to cry as an actor, so if Im in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling."
meld_577_2,"Or ah, or, lets say I wanna convey that Ive just done something evil."
meld_577_3,"That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it  Okay, lets say Ive just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13."
meld_577_4,And thats how its done.
meld_577_5,"Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
meld_577_6,"Hey, Mr. Trib."
meld_577_7,Hey-hey.
meld_578_0,Then Im gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
meld_578_1,Who are you?
meld_578_2,"Hi, Im Eric, Im gonna be Chandlers new roommate."
meld_578_3,Im Chandlers new roommate.
meld_578_4,I-I-I dont think so.
meld_578_5,I could be Chandlers new roommate.
meld_578_6,"But, he told me over the phone."
meld_578_7,He told me in person.
meld_578_8,Thats weird.
meld_578_9,"Well, Im going to go into my new apartment now.  Ehh!"
meld_579_0,Hey! Look who I found!
meld_579_1,"Oh, hey guys!"
meld_580_0,"Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden."
meld_580_1,"Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter."
meld_581_0,Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas?
meld_582_0,Didnt think so!
meld_583_0,"Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!"
meld_583_1,"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?"
meld_583_2,"Hmm, how about my azzz?"
meld_583_3,"Hey, this is hollow."
meld_583_4,What?
meld_583_5,"This bench, its hollow! I cant believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!"
meld_583_6,"No, dont look directly at them!"
meld_583_7,What?
meld_583_8,"Alright, no, we could look at them!"
meld_583_9,I
meld_584_0,"Hi! Im so glad youre here, but its gonna be a while. I-I wished youd called first."
meld_584_1,"Oh thats all right, Im coming back later with your father."
meld_584_2,Oh good.
meld_584_3,I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
meld_584_4,"Okay, whats up?"
meld_584_5,"I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it."
meld_584_6,"Ma, youre asking me to marry you?"
meld_584_7,"This is your grandmothers engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel."
meld_584_8,"Mom no, come on! Thank you."
meld_584_9,Just hear me out!
meld_585_0,"Maybe this wouldve happened if Id been more nurturing, or Id paid more attention, or I... had a uterus."
meld_585_1,I cant believe this!
meld_585_2,"I know no, no, y'know you dont deserve this, you dont Ross."
meld_585_3,"Youre, youre really, youre so good."
meld_585_4,Thanks.
meld_585_5,And youre so sweet.  And youre kind
meld_585_6,Thanks.
meld_585_7,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
meld_585_8,"Okay, its okay."
meld_585_9,"Wait, wait, wait."
meld_585_10,My foot is stuck in the pocket.
meld_585_11,What?
meld_585_12,"No, I cant get it out."
meld_586_0,Rachel?

meld_587_5,Congratulations...oh..wow
meld_588_0,I cant believe I did this! What an idiot!
meld_588_1,"Oh, stop beating yourself up!"
meld_588_2,People make mistakes!
meld_588_3,These things happen!
meld_588_4,There arent any message youve forgotten to give me are there?
meld_588_5,Apparently youre not very good at it!
meld_588_6,I

meld_589_1,"Oh my God! So was she! Oh, Ive got-Ive got goose bumps."
meld_589_2,Really?
meld_589_3,"Well, yknow Im wearing layers and its warm."
meld_589_4,Yeah.
meld_589_5,"But ifno look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!"
meld_589_6,Did you hear that?!
meld_589_7,I dont need you guys to care about me!
meld_589_8,Because the universe cares!
meld_589_9,The whole universe!
meld_589_10,I really wished theyd care just a little bit though.
meld_590_0,"I like this one.  It seems to say, ""I love you and thats why I have to kill you."""
meld_590_1,"They cant all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is."
meld_590_2,Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
meld_590_3,Do you really want to pull at that thread?
meld_590_4,Im having a really good time!
meld_590_5,Me too! Im sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
meld_590_6,"Ohh. No thats okay, hes a friend."
meld_590_7,"Hey uh, I dont mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?"
meld_590_8,"Yeah, I Well yknow I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so Id just be lost."
meld_590_9,"I know its really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss andOh no! No! No! My God!"
meld_590_10,"Okay, dont freak out. Ill go."
meld_590_11,"No its Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!"
meld_590_12,"Okay, I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross?"
meld_590_13,Yeah?
meld_590_14,"Yeah, umm thats Whitney , Kyles ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can yknow divert her so that we can slip out?"
meld_590_15,What?! No!
meld_590_16,Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
meld_590_17,"Look, I dont think so Pheebs.  All right, Ill do it. But just because youre a friend."
meld_591_0,"Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?"
meld_591_1,I'll take sports.
meld_591_2,Mine!
meld_591_3,"All right. Uhh, international."
meld_592_0,"Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say"
meld_592_1,You two will have very hairy children.

meld_592_3,Ross! Janice?!
meld_592_4,"All right, hold on!"
meld_592_5,Hold on.
meld_592_6,Hold on.
meld_592_7,"This is Ross, okay?"
meld_592_8,He's our friend.
meld_592_9,He obviously went crazy.
meld_592_10,He obviously lost his mind.
meld_592_11,So are you actually gonna see her again?
meld_592_12,Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
meld_592_13,Damnit Phoebe!!
meld_593_0,"Hey, dont we have to..."
meld_593_1,"Yeah, we got, um-hmm."
meld_593_2,"Umm, I think youre really, really great..."
meld_593_3,Oh God!
meld_593_4,Here we go again.
meld_593_5,Why does this keep happening to me?
meld_593_6,Is it something Im putting out there?
meld_593_7,Is this my fault?
meld_593_8,Or am I just nuts?
meld_593_9,"I-I-I-I-I dont know, I dont know what to say."
meld_593_10,"Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house."
meld_594_0,Wait!
meld_594_1,Terry!
meld_594_2,Please!
meld_594_3,"Look, I just lost my other job."
meld_594_4,Okay?
meld_594_5,You have no idea how much I need this.
meld_594_6,"Please, help me out, for old times sake."
meld_594_7,This poor guys been in a coma for five years. Its hopeless.
meld_594_8,"Its not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramorays a miracle worker. Look, here he comes."
meld_594_9,"Good morning.  Drake, its your brother Stryker. Can you hear me?"
meld_594_10,Im back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
meld_595_0,That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
meld_595_1,Well you did pull his hair.
meld_595_2,He took my snack!
meld_595_3,Im not getting into this again!
meld_595_4,"Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad."
meld_595_5,"Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay."
meld_595_6,"This doesnt mean anything, does it?"
meld_596_0,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?
meld_596_1,That is true.
meld_596_2,"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun."
meld_596_3,"Oh, Ive been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche."
meld_596_4,"Joey, you know you dont actually have one."
meld_596_5,Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her!
meld_596_6,"Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me."
meld_596_7,"All right, thats it, were going to the emergency room."
meld_596_8,"What?! No, you cant, you cant leave me here with them! Were baby-sitting!"
meld_596_9,"The babies are asleep, Im sure youll be okay on your own for a while!"
meld_596_10,But you-you cant leave me with them! We-were a team! Were playing a zone! Theyre gonna triple team me!
meld_596_11,"Hes got something plastic lodged in his throat, weve got to go to the hospital."
meld_596_12,"But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years."
meld_596_13,I think thats gum.
meld_596_14,Im pretty sure its gun.
meld_596_15,"Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go."
meld_596_16,"A real man wouldnt just run to the hospital!  No! What would, what would Krog do?"
meld_596_17,That was the only way I could get him to
meld_596_18,Hi! How are the Gellers?
meld_596_19,Dont call us that!
meld_596_20,The judge wouldnt let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
meld_596_21,Hey! Its Porsche!!
meld_597_0,Hey sweetie!
meld_597_1,Hey!
meld_597_2,Theres no back to this couch!
meld_597_3,Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
meld_597_4,"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow?"
meld_597_5,"Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside."
meld_597_6,"Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you."
meld_597_7,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
meld_597_8,Stop it!
meld_597_9,"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this."
meld_597_10,"I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here."
meld_597_11,Yeah?
meld_598_0,Of course he is!
meld_598_1,"What, do you think Id just use my son as-as an excuse?"
meld_598_2,What kind of father do you think I am?
meld_598_3,"All right, sorry."
meld_598_4,I gotta go make a fake Ben.
meld_599_0,"The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!"
meld_599_1,"Well, either that or uh"
meld_599_2,Joey!!
meld_599_3,Yeah?
meld_599_4,Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
meld_599_5,"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!"
meld_599_6,"Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it!"
meld_599_7,They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!!
meld_599_8,"Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something mightve happened to a huge chunk of it."
meld_599_9,Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
meld_599_10,Mine stole my newspaper! Its like a
meld_599_11,Sure!
meld_599_12,"Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldnt stop thinking about it."
meld_599_13,"I mean, everyone should have a-a"
meld_599_14,Oh my God Ross!!
meld_599_15,You like it?
meld_599_16,I
meld_599_17,Yeah?
meld_600_0,Hello darlings.
meld_600_1,And theres daddy!
meld_601_0,There he is! There he is!
meld_601_1,Where?
meld_601_2,Right- where we've been looking all night!
meld_601_3,He is so cute!
meld_601_4,"Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"
meld_601_5,"Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop thewowww."
meld_602_0,"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
meld_602_1,"Yeah, isn't he?"
meld_602_2,"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight."
meld_602_3,You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
meld_602_4,Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
meld_602_5,Huh. That's nice.
meld_603_0,"and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for"
meld_603_1,Eight whole days.
meld_603_2,"Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end."
meld_603_3,Awesome!
meld_603_4,Yeah?
meld_603_5,My favorite part was when
meld_603_6,The Armadillo was actually not so
meld_603_7,Hey!
meld_603_8,Oh.
meld_603_9,Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunnys funeral in here.
meld_603_10,"Come on, come on, were-were-were lighting the candles!"
meld_603_11,Oh.
meld_603_12,Oh.
meld_603_13,"Okay, I understand why"
meld_604_0,"Yeah, sure. Good luck!"
meld_604_1,Im quitting!! Woo-hoo!  Im okay!! Im all right!!
meld_604_2,"Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman."
meld_604_3,What?
meld_604_4,"Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?"
meld_604_5,Why would you say that?
meld_604_6,Cause youre still into Monica.
meld_604_7,"So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and..."
meld_604_8,Youre good. Youre good!
meld_604_9,"Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift."
meld_604_10,"Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?"
meld_604_11,"Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?"
meld_604_12,Thanks a lot.
meld_604_13,"No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks."
meld_605_0,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi."
meld_605_1,"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!"
meld_605_2,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
meld_605_3,"Oh, thanks, sweetie."
meld_605_4,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
meld_605_5,Really?
meld_605_6,You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
meld_605_7,"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
meld_605_8,Can't wait.
meld_606_0,Do I know you?
meld_606_1,"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?"
meld_606_2,"Good, good, I'm a lawyer now."
meld_606_3,You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
meld_606_4,"Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage."
meld_606_5,"Uh, wait, backstage?"
meld_606_6,"Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band."
meld_606_7,Ross.
meld_606_8,Chandler.
meld_606_9,"Look, you guys wanna meet the group?"
meld_606_10,Come on.
meld_606_11,"So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?"
meld_607_0,Do you have any respect for your body?
meld_607_1,Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
meld_607_2,"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease."
meld_607_3,"The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
meld_607_4,"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you."
meld_607_5,Really?
meld_607_6,He does?
meld_607_7,"Hey, buddy, what's up!"
meld_607_8,"Oh, she told you about that, huh."
meld_607_9,"Well, yeah, I have one now and then."
meld_607_10,"Well, yeah, now."
meld_607_11,"Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before."
meld_607_12,"Well, okay, thanks!"
meld_607_13,"God, he's good."
meld_607_14,If only he were a woman.
meld_607_15,Yeah.
meld_608_0,"Oh, look look look."
meld_608_1,The last candle's about to burn out.
meld_608_2,"10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48...."
meld_608_3,Thank you.
meld_608_4,Thanks.
meld_608_5,Kinda... spooky without any lights.
meld_608_6,Bwah-hah-hah!
meld_608_7,"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..."
meld_608_8,Oh.. oh... oh.
meld_608_9,"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica."
meld_609_0,"All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?"
meld_610_0,You blew them away!
meld_610_1,"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!"
meld_610_2,"I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?"
meld_610_3,I was
meld_610_4,"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!"
meld_610_5,Oh my God!  I'm your
meld_610_6,I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
meld_610_7,"Look, I took it too far!"
meld_611_0,"Okay, Monica: Right foot red."
meld_611_1,Could've played
meld_611_2,Thanks.
meld_611_3,"Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good."
meld_611_4,"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the"
meld_611_5,"Oh, okay. Will you take my place?"
meld_611_6,"Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel."
meld_611_7,Nooo!
meld_611_8,Hello?
meld_611_9,"Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much."
meld_611_10,"Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really."
meld_611_11,Green. To the green.
meld_611_12,I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.
meld_611_13,"To the left, to the left- aww!"
meld_611_14,Ohhh... I'm fine.
meld_612_0,Hey!
meld_612_1,Please tell me you got the message!
meld_612_2,What message?
meld_612_3,"The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock."
meld_612_4,What?! Its 6 oclock!
meld_612_5,"Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!"
meld_612_6,"I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!"
meld_612_7,I went to Rosss!
meld_612_8,I went to the coffeehouse!
meld_612_9,I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
meld_613_0,"Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day."
meld_613_1,Thats what you think.
meld_613_2,"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?"
meld_613_3,"Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse."
meld_613_4,What was her name?
meld_613_5,Nestley Toulouse.
meld_613_6,Nestlé Toll House?
meld_613_7,"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language."
meld_613_8,Yes!!  Oh.
meld_613_9,I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
meld_613_10,I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!!
meld_614_0,"So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?"
meld_614_1,Absolutely!
meld_614_2,I am so on board!
meld_614_3,Rachel didn't you just light that?
meld_614_4,"Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach."
meld_614_5,I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
meld_614_6,"Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like"
meld_614_7,Tell me about it!
meld_614_8,Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
meld_614_9,It does sound appealing.
meld_614_10,"Oh, I never could do it."
meld_614_11,Oh but you could.
meld_614_12,You can.
meld_614_13,Absolutely!
meld_614_14,We can help each other out!
meld_614_15,We can get--what are those--those patches!
meld_614_16,We could be like the Patch Sisters!
meld_614_17,"Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!"
meld_614_18,Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
meld_614_19,My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.
meld_614_20,Okay then!
meld_615_0,"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
meld_615_1,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
meld_615_2,Nooo..
meld_615_3,"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!"
meld_615_4,It's worse than the thumb!
meld_615_5,"Hey, this is so unfair!"
meld_615_6,"Oh, why is it unfair?"
meld_615_7,So I have a flaw!
meld_615_8,Big deal!
meld_615_9,Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
meld_615_10,"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?"
meld_615_11,"And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?"
meld_615_12,"I mean, what the hell is that thing?"
meld_615_13,"...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
meld_615_14,...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
meld_615_15,"Well, I-I could live without it."
meld_615_16,"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?"
meld_615_17,"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
meld_615_18,"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?"
meld_615_19,"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
meld_615_20,"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work."
meld_615_21,"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
meld_615_22,"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on."
meld_616_0,Awww! Mel Torme died.
meld_616_1,"Joey, that papers like a year old!"
meld_616_2,Aw! Does that mean the
meld_616_3,Hey.
meld_616_4,Hey.
meld_617_0,You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
meld_617_1,"Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does."
meld_617_2,Probably?
meld_617_3,"Yeah, I don't like that word."
meld_617_4,Kind of what probably really means.
meld_617_5,"Yeah, uh-huh."
meld_617_6,"Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" yknow?"
meld_617_7,"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"""
meld_617_8,You gotta take care of yourselves!
meld_617_9,In
meld_617_10,"Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?"
meld_618_0,Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
meld_618_1,Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?
meld_619_0,Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?
meld_619_1,"Oh, Im fine."
meld_619_2,"Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone."
meld_619_3,"Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross."
meld_619_4,"Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?"
meld_619_5,"Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!"
meld_619_6,"Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family."
meld_619_7,Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.
meld_619_8,"Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs."
meld_620_0,"And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here."
meld_621_0,Hey. Whos that?
meld_621_1,New people.
meld_621_2,What happened to the Disgustingtons?
meld_621_3,Theyre having their baby!
meld_621_4,Its not fair Ross we got here first!
meld_621_5,Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.
meld_621_6,Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
meld_621_7,"Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?"
meld_622_0,Phoebe?
meld_622_1,Yeah?
meld_622_2,"Look at that guy by the window, wow!"
meld_622_3,"Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed."
meld_622_4,"Oh, what is wrong with me lately?"
meld_622_5,I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.
meld_622_6,"Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack."
meld_622_7,"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?"
meld_622_8,Yeah.
meld_622_9,"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy."
meld_622_10,Really?! So this has happened to you?
meld_622_11,Oh absolutely yeah!
meld_622_12,"Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy."
meld_622_13,"Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap."
meld_622_14,"Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a"
meld_623_0,Ugh!
meld_623_1,I dont know what Im going to do!
meld_623_2,I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!
meld_623_3,"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?"
meld_623_4,Hey guys!
meld_623_5,Hey!
meld_623_6,Hey
meld_623_7,"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!"
meld_623_8,And the guys from work had a blast.
meld_623_9,"Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before."
meld_623_10,Yeah!
meld_623_11,"And-and another one had never been to a party before, so"
meld_623_12,"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!"
meld_623_13,"Yeah, right!"
meld_623_14,"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those"
meld_623_15,"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her."
meld_623_16,"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?"
meld_623_17,"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life."
meld_623_18,"So you might say, its a magic ring."
meld_624_0,OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
meld_625_0,Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
meld_625_1,"Obviously! So, how do we decide?"
meld_625_2,"Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her"
meld_625_3,Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
meld_625_4,"Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her"
meld_625_5,Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
meld_625_6,"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while."
meld_625_7,Yeah well we should order some food then.
meld_625_8,"No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well"
meld_625_9,That sounds fair.
meld_625_10,Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street
meld_625_11,Ah yeahwait a second now!
meld_625_12,Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
meld_625_13,I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
meld_625_14,"Well sorry, thats what I do on dates."
meld_625_15,"All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates."
meld_625_16,So lets decide on the spending limit
meld_625_17,"Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?"
meld_625_18,I was thinking more like a hundred.
meld_625_19,Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
meld_626_0,"Hi, again."
meld_626_1,Hey!
meld_626_2,Hey!
meld_626_3,"Thank you soo, much."
meld_626_4,"Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work."
meld_626_5,You want some help with that?
meld_626_6,"Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!"
meld_626_7,Whoa! Are you okay?
meld_626_8,"Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush."
meld_626_9,Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.
meld_626_10,"Thats a uh, thats a tough combination."
meld_626_11,Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
meld_626_12,Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
meld_626_13,What do you mean?
meld_627_0,Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
meld_628_0,Oh!
meld_628_1,"Hey, somebody left their keys."
meld_628_2,"Ooohh, to a Porsche!"
meld_628_3,"Hey Gunther, these yours?"
meld_628_4,"Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!"
meld_628_5,Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
meld_628_6,"Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?"
meld_628_7,Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!
meld_628_8,You left a shoe here?!
meld_628_9,"Well, I didnt realize until I got home."
meld_628_10,I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
meld_628_11,Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.
meld_628_12,"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe."
meld_628_13,Great! Thanks.
meld_629_0,"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep."
meld_629_1,"Carol, we've been through this before, ok?"
meld_629_2,We have a good time.
meld_629_3,"We laugh, we play."
meld_629_4,It's like we're father and son.
meld_629_5,"Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person."
meld_629_6,"Oh, this is so cute."
meld_629_7,"Oh, I got that for him."
meld_629_8,My mommies love me. That's clever.
meld_629_9,Hello?
meld_629_10,"Oh, Hi, JuHi, Jew!"
meld_629_11,Uh huh?
meld_629_12,Uh huh?
meld_629_13,"Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great."
meld_629_14,See ya then.
meld_629_15,Bye.
meld_629_16,"Did you just say Hi, Jew?"
meld_629_17,"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith."
meld_630_0,Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!
meld_630_1,Thanks Monica!
meld_630_2,Does that smell bother you?
meld_630_3,"What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here."
meld_630_4,"Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it."
meld_630_5,"I can smell it a little, bake the pie."
meld_630_6,Okay!
meld_630_7,Okay.
meld_630_8,"Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector."
meld_630_9,Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
meld_630_10,"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire."
meld_630_11,"No-no, it was the candles."
meld_630_12,Its very not good leaving candles unattended.
meld_630_13,"In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay."
meld_630_14,"Well, I have to go now."
meld_631_0,Joey proposed to me.
meld_632_0,Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!
meld_632_1,"Well, I-I said yes."
meld_632_2,What?!
meld_632_3,Are you crazy?
meld_632_4,You just had Ross’s baby!
meld_632_5,It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.
meld_632_6,"No, it’s worse than that."
meld_632_7,It’s wrong.
meld_632_8,It’s… It is bigger than  mine!
meld_632_9,I know.
meld_632_10,You can’t marry him!
meld_632_11,Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.
meld_632_12,Well do you love him?
meld_632_13,Sure.
meld_632_14,Sure?
meld_632_15,"Yeah, I mean whatever."
meld_632_16,"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?"
meld_632_17,"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?"
meld_633_0,So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
meld_633_1,Here comes the bride.
meld_633_2,Oh my God Monica!
meld_633_3,I wanna wear this everyday.
meld_633_4,You look so beautiful.
meld_633_5,Im so happy for me.
meld_633_6,Hello?
meld_633_7,Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
meld_633_8,"Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine."
meld_633_9,Damnit!
meld_634_0,"I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?"
meld_634_1,Fine.
meld_634_2,"Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel."
meld_634_3,And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!
meld_634_4,"No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I"
meld_634_5,"Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!"
meld_634_6,And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!
meld_634_7,Crap!!
meld_634_8,I gotta go!
meld_635_0,Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
meld_635_1,No.
meld_635_2,Me neither! We have to get in!
meld_635_3,Just act like you belong.
meld_635_4,Oh my God! Oranges!
meld_635_5,Shh!  Nice to see you again.
meld_635_6,"Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?"
meld_635_7,"Yes, of course."
meld_635_8,"Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number."
meld_635_9,"Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A."
meld_636_0,Okay!
meld_636_1,Yknow what?
meld_636_2,I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
meld_636_3,All I really needed was a plan.
meld_636_4,See I wanna have three kids
meld_636_5,"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother."
meld_636_6,As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.
meld_637_0,You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!
meld_637_1,"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,"
meld_637_2,Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!
meld_637_3,Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
meld_637_4,I dont know.
meld_637_5,Why am I not surprised?
meld_637_6,Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!
meld_637_7,I dont think you have much choice.
meld_637_8,Well well see!
meld_637_9,Bye-bye!
meld_637_10,Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
meld_637_11,Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
meld_638_0,Dad?
meld_638_1,Im here!
meld_638_2,Hey!
meld_638_3,"Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work."
meld_638_4,"Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house."
meld_638_5,"Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling."
meld_638_6,Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
meld_638_7,Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
meld_638_8,"Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories"
meld_638_9,"Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven"
meld_638_10,I used to
meld_638_11,"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater."
meld_638_12,"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a"
meld_639_0,"Ok, got the vent open."
meld_639_1,"Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!"
meld_639_2,"Ben, you ready?"
meld_639_3,"All right, gimme your foot."
meld_639_4,"Ok, on three, Ben."
meld_639_5,"One, two, three."
meld_639_6,"Ok, That's it, Ben."
meld_639_7,What do you see?
meld_639_8,"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent."
meld_639_9,"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!"
meld_639_10,Wait! You forgot your legs!
meld_640_0,"You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system."
meld_640_1,Thank you.
meld_640_2,Filing system?
meld_640_3,Oh-oh!
meld_640_4,You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
meld_640_5,It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
meld_640_6,"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that."
meld_640_7,I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
meld_640_8,"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me."
meld_640_9,Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost
meld_640_10,"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that."
meld_640_11,"Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!"
meld_640_12,"Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers."
meld_640_13,"Yes, I realize that"
meld_640_14,"And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean."
meld_640_15,I love working with designers!
meld_640_16,"With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?"
meld_641_0,"Chandler, you have an assistant right?"
meld_641_1,Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
meld_642_0,"Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile."
meld_642_1,I do?
meld_642_2,"Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy."
meld_642_3,Okay.
meld_642_4,Or not.
meld_643_0,Where's Chandler?
meld_643_1,Here I am.
meld_643_2,Wash your hands!!!
meld_643_3,How did youknow?
meld_643_4,Hey! What's she doing back here?
meld_643_5,"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!"
meld_643_6,"Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically..."
meld_644_0,What happened in Atlantic City?!
meld_644_1,"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar"
meld_644_2,"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""
meld_644_3,"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?"
meld_644_4,"So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing."
meld_644_5,"Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls."
meld_644_6,You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
meld_644_7,"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
meld_644_8,"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard"
meld_644_9,"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
meld_644_10,"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
meld_645_0,"So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?"
meld_645_1,Of course I am!
meld_645_2,"Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot."
meld_645_3,"Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes."
meld_645_4,And-and then guess what?
meld_645_5,The babys coming and I dont know what to do.
meld_645_6,"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?"
meld_645_7,"No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine."
meld_645_8,Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
meld_645_9,Im going to the bathroom.
meld_645_10,Okay.
meld_645_11,Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.
meld_645_12,It
meld_645_13,Hey!
meld_645_14,Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
meld_645_15,I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
meld_645_16,Not if you were here.
meld_646_0,"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor."
meld_646_1,Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!
meld_646_2,I hope its you.
meld_646_3,Me too!
meld_646_4,"First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me"
meld_646_5,"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!"
meld_646_6,"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other."
meld_646_7,"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine"
meld_646_8,Yes!!! Oh!!
meld_646_9,Hypothetically!
meld_646_10,Still.
meld_646_11,If Phoebe were my maid of honor
meld_646_12,"Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset."
meld_646_13,Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.
meld_646_14,"Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?"
meld_646_15,"Well thats the best part. Umm,"
meld_646_16,Wh-why is that the best part?
meld_646_17,Because then I dont have to!
meld_646_18,Well of
meld_646_19,Im really not deciding!
meld_646_20,Fine!
meld_646_21,"Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!"
meld_647_0,"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?"
meld_648_0,It's not just the drum noise.
meld_648_1,"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!"
meld_648_2,"Oh god, my eye!"""
meld_648_3,"I mean, it is so annoying."
meld_648_4,"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums."
meld_648_5,"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?"
meld_648_6,Maybe on some level.
meld_649_0,Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
meld_649_1,"No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you."
meld_649_2,"Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you."
meld_649_3,"And, a brownie!"
meld_649_4,"Well, half a brownie."
meld_649_5,"Actually, its just bag."
meld_649_6,Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so
meld_649_7,Oh man!
meld_649_8,This is so great!
meld_649_9,I actually feel like Im going on a real date!
meld_649_10,"Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere."
meld_649_11,"Hey come on now, this is a real date."
meld_649_12,"Uh, sonice place you got here."
meld_649_13,"Foosball, huh?"
meld_649_14,Pizza box.
meld_649_15,"Oh, a subscription to"
meld_649_16,"Yeah, actually thats my roommates."
meld_649_17,I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
meld_649_18,"Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself."
meld_649_19,"Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?"
meld_649_20,Hm-mmm
meld_649_21,"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?"
meld_649_22,"Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay."
meld_649_23,"No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!"
meld_650_0,Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
meld_650_1,"Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive."
meld_650_2,"Ha. Ha, ha."
meld_650_3,What?
meld_650_4,"Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black."
meld_650_5,Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
meld_650_6,"Oh, I beg to differ. The"
meld_650_7,That was
meld_650_8,Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
meld_651_0,"Well, not playing raquetball!"
meld_651_1,He forgot to leave his grip size!
meld_651_2,He didn't get the goggles!
meld_651_3,"Well,sounds like you two have issues."
meld_651_4,"Goodbye, baby."
meld_651_5,"Ciao, bela."
meld_651_6,Do they wait for me to do this?
meld_651_7,So are you gonna tell him?
meld_651_8,Why would I tell him?
meld_651_9,"How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."
meld_651_10,What are you guys doing here?
meld_651_11,Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
meld_651_12,...What did I ask?
meld_652_0,God. I feel violated.
meld_652_1,"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?"
meld_652_2,"Ross, ten o'clock."
meld_652_3,Is it? Feels like two.
meld_652_4,"No,"
meld_652_5,"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!"
meld_652_6,Oh. Hel-lo!
meld_652_7,"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!"
meld_652_8,"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone."
meld_652_9,"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'"
meld_652_10,"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!"
meld_652_11,"Oh please, could she"
meld_652_12,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
meld_652_13,"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys."
meld_652_14,You could do that!
meld_652_15,You think?
meld_653_0,"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
meld_653_1,OK.
meld_653_2,"This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?"
meld_653_3,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
meld_653_4,"Last time I do that, I promise."
meld_654_0,"I am so, so, so, so sorry!"
meld_654_1,Uh-huh.
meld_654_2,"And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!"
meld_654_3,"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin me?!"
meld_654_4,"Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please? Please-please, please?"
meld_654_5,Okay.
meld_654_6,Okay.
meld_654_7,"So, are we going in there?"
meld_654_8,I am!!
meld_655_0,Wow!
meld_655_1,It actually is in the handbook.
meld_655_2,I cant date you or have a hot plate in my office.
meld_655_3,I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.
meld_655_4,For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
meld_655_5,"I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden."
meld_655_6,Wow!
meld_655_7,What?
meld_655_8,"Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot."
meld_655_9,Really?
meld_655_10,Yeah.
meld_655_11,"Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its wrong."
meld_655_12,Stop it!
meld_655_13,No! No! Its wrong! Its-its-its naughty. Its taboo.
meld_655_14,Shut the book!
meld_655_15,Lets also get a hot plate!
meld_656_0,"Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends"
meld_657_0,Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
meld_657_1,"Oh Im not, I just like to try these on."
meld_657_2,I do the same thing.
meld_657_3,Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25
meld_657_4,Im just kidding too.  Im getting married in December.
meld_657_5,So when are you getting married?
meld_657_6,Oh May 15
meld_657_7,Oooh its getting close!
meld_657_8,"So uh, whos your photographer?"
meld_657_9,Jeffrey
meld_657_10,We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
meld_657_11,The best man? Wow!
meld_657_12,"I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?!"
meld_657_13,"Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings."
meld_657_14,"Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass."
meld_657_15,"Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God! It doesnt matter; theyre both great!"
meld_657_16,Oh yknow what?
meld_657_17,Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off.
meld_657_18,This place is so overpriced.
meld_657_19,"So, does this  come in another color or"
meld_658_0,"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time."
meld_658_1,It was unbelievable!
meld_658_2,"We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
meld_658_3,So have you called her yet?
meld_658_4,Let her know I like her?
meld_658_5,"What are you, insane?"
meld_658_6,It's the next day!
meld_658_7,How needy do I want to seem?
meld_658_8,"I'm right, right?"
meld_658_9,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle."
meld_658_10,I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
meld_658_11,"Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!"
meld_658_12,"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine."
meld_658_13,Her answer machine?
meld_658_14,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
meld_658_15,"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?"
meld_658_16,"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
meld_658_17,"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!"
meld_658_18,"Okay, okay, what's going on?"
meld_658_19,"Okay, they're just talking..."
meld_658_20,"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?"
meld_659_0,"So, um, what do you do for a living?"
meld_659_1,"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major."
meld_659_2,Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
meld_659_3,I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
meld_659_4,Now that is funny.
meld_659_5,"Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?"
meld_659_6,"Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
meld_659_7,I guess.
meld_659_8,Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
meld_659_9,"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine."
meld_659_10,Come on.
meld_659_11,These people'll scooch down.
meld_659_12,"You guys'll scooch, won't you?"
meld_659_13,Let's try scooching!
meld_659_14,Come on.
meld_659_15,Come on.
meld_659_16,"Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick."
meld_659_17,"Carol, Kristin."
meld_659_18,"Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade."
meld_659_19,"And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
meld_660_0,Okay.
meld_660_1,When I was six years old.
meld_660_2,Hm-mm
meld_660_3,I wanted a big wheel.
meld_660_4,And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.
meld_660_5,"It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me."
meld_660_6,That was a pretty tough year.
meld_660_7,Thats-thats great!
meld_660_8,See?
meld_660_9,I already feel like I know you a little better!
meld_660_10,Thank you.
meld_660_11,"Okay, come on."
meld_660_12,Now we can go eat.
meld_660_13,Lets go.
meld_660_14,It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
meld_660_15,Oh!
meld_661_0,"Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?"
meld_661_1,That's patio furniture!
meld_661_2,"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!"
meld_661_3,What about the birds?
meld_661_4,"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something."""
meld_661_5,You pick one.
meld_661_6,"All right, how about the ladybugs?"
meld_661_7,"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"
meld_661_8,"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
meld_661_9,"Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!"
meld_662_0,Bijan for men?
meld_662_1,Bijan for men?
meld_662_2,"Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee."
meld_662_3,"Oh, actually I sorta have plans."
meld_662_4,"Ready, Annabelle?"
meld_662_5,You bet.  Maybe some other time?
meld_662_6,"Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!"
meld_663_0,That was amazing!
meld_663_1,Phoebe and Gary are
meld_663_2,That was amazing.
meld_663_3,We are the hottest! Huh?
meld_663_4,"No, you're the best."
meld_663_5,"No, you're the best."
meld_663_6,"No, you're the best."
meld_663_7,I
meld_663_8,Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'?
meld_663_9,Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
meld_664_0,So what are you gonna do?
meld_664_1,"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up."
meld_664_2,"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
meld_664_3,"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?"
meld_664_4,"Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!"
meld_664_5,Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
meld_664_6,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny."
meld_664_7,Why? What happened to him?
meld_664_8,"Nothing, hes just really believes in that."
meld_665_0,It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
meld_665_1,Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
meld_665_2,"Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there."
meld_665_3,"Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos."
meld_665_4,"Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?"""
meld_665_5,"Um-hmm, five actually."
meld_665_6,"Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?"

meld_671_2,"No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"
meld_671_3,"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y."

meld_671_6,Phonetically?
meld_671_7,"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this."
meld_671_8,"Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"

meld_672_10,"Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it? part just another glance."
meld_672_11,"What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!"
meld_672_12,"Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even"

meld_673_7,"Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?"
meld_673_8,"Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do"
meld_673_9,"Oh, thats better then."

meld_673_17,And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
meld_673_18,Ooh!
meld_673_19,Theres no way to do this without her?
meld_673_20,"Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
meld_674_0,"So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones."
meld_674_1,"But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game."
meld_674_2,"Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed."

meld_674_4,"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
meld_674_5,"That's alright, I'll take it."
meld_674_6,Bad things happen to me anyway.

meld_678_17,"And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker."

meld_707_12,And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too!
meld_707_13,Hi Bob!
meld_707_14,I thought I told you to get outta here!
meld_707_15,"Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot."
meld_708_0,"Well, because we thought you knew!! Its so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."""
meld_709_0,Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
meld_709_1,"Oh no, I cant go. Im practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show."
meld_710_0,Oh cool!

meld_712_1,Youll be perfect for this! Thats already your name!

meld_712_3,Well do you want some help?
meld_712_4,Oh really? Thatd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
meld_712_5,Awesome!

meld_713_1,"Oh honey, I think Im having one too!"
meld_713_2,Look at this!  There we go!
meld_714_0,"Excuse me. Hi, Im a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?"
meld_714_1,"Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift."
meld_714_2,No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
meld_714_3,How can I help you?
meld_714_4,"Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section?"
meld_714_5,"See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it."
meld_715_0,We are aware of the problem you are referring to.
meld_716_0,"But as far as increasing security, Im afraid the library is very understaffed."
meld_716_1,"I, I cant help you."
meld_716_2,"Well, fine."
meld_716_3,Fine!
meld_716_4,"If-if Im the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, Ill go up there and defend it myself!"
meld_716_5,And dont you follow me!
meld_717_0,"Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?"
meld_717_1,"Oh my God! Phoebe look, its Ross and that girl."
meld_717_2,No! No! Look at that!  Its a line of ants! Theyre working as a team!
meld_717_3,"Right, oh yeah."
meld_717_4,"Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her."
meld_717_5,"Uff, I hope he lets her down easy."
meld_717_6,"Come on Phoebe, look at that!"
meld_717_7,"They are not breaking up, look at them."
meld_717_8,"Okay thats, you know what that is?"
meld_717_9,"That is a, that is a second date, thats what that is!"
meld_717_10,"Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh..."
meld_717_11,"Oh no! That really is nothing, she is"
meld_717_12,"Ohh!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, hes gonna marry her, and this is all your fault."
meld_718_0,You know where I work!
meld_718_1,I do?
meld_718_2,"The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time."
meld_718_3,You still work at the multiplex?
meld_718_4,"Oh, like Id give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room."
meld_718_5,"Thanks, Im set. Do you still live with your parents?"
meld_718_6,"Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want."
meld_719_0,Nice car!

meld_720_7,"All right, I have one question."
meld_720_8,Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
meld_720_9,"No, the quiet down thing!"
meld_720_10,You mean this.
meld_720_11,"Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my"
meld_720_12,"All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!"
meld_720_13,"All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game."

meld_722_0,I know it doesn't make much sense
meld_722_1,Much
meld_722_2,"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!"
meld_722_3,"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
meld_722_4,"I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!"
meld_722_5,"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me."
meld_722_6,No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
meld_722_7,Really?!
meld_722_8,"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here."
meld_722_9,Thanks.
meld_722_10,"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!"
meld_722_11,How good is that?
meld_722_12,"Oh-oi-ho, yeah!"
meld_722_13,See?
meld_722_14,"Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!"
meld_722_15,I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
meld_722_16,Yeah. With a bite!  Gee-e-e-eez!
meld_723_0,Check out the ring.
meld_723_1,Nice! One and a half carat easy.

meld_723_3,Hey-hey Pheebs!
meld_723_4,Chandlers gonna ask Monica to marry him!
meld_723_5,"Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring."
meld_723_6,You told her before you told us?
meld_723_7,"Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right?  Guys? Guys?"
meld_724_0,Let's see.
meld_724_1,"Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports."
meld_724_2,What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
meld_724_3,Nah... not-not special enough.
meld_724_4,Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
meld_724_5,Waaay too special.
meld_725_0,Hey Pheebs!
meld_725_1,Hey!
meld_725_2,Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!
meld_725_3,Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
meld_725_4,"Yknow, Im beginning to see what Jake was talking about."
meld_725_5,Uh-huh.
meld_725_6,The silk? Feels really good!
meld_726_0,"Ah yeah, sorry about that."
meld_726_1,"Its okay. Come, come on in."
meld_726_2,"Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monicas place was nice, but her fiancée sure stares a lot."
meld_726_3,Oh.
meld_726_4,Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
meld_726_5,"Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions."
meld_726_6,"Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me."
meld_726_7,YeahNo!!
meld_727_0,"Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out!  Guess which job I got."
meld_727_1,"I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black."
meld_727_2,What?
meld_727_3,Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
meld_727_4,But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
meld_727_5,"Well, you-you know what I meant."
meld_727_6,"No, you messed it up. Youre stupid."
meld_727_7,So what job did you get Joe?
meld_727_8,"Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me."
meld_727_9,"Well, how can you be a tour guide, dont you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?"
meld_728_0,I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
meld_728_1,"Y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a"
meld_728_2,It just keeps getting worse and worse!
meld_728_3,"I mean its bad enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think she knows."
meld_728_4,Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us.
meld_728_5,"And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too."
meld_728_6,And now I have seen her naked.
meld_728_7,"I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something."
meld_728_8,"But there are no boles, shes smooth!"
meld_728_9,Smooth!
meld_728_10,Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
meld_728_11,Yeah! Oh my God!
meld_729_0,"So, you and Angela, huh?"
meld_729_1,Yep. Pretty much.
meld_730_0,"Oh, that's what she meant!"
meld_730_1,"You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!"
meld_730_2,"You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!"
meld_730_3,"Yeah, most of it it's a place"
meld_730_4,"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."
meld_730_5,"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison    Avenue."
meld_730_6,You know what?
meld_730_7,"She loves architecture, you know what you should do?"
meld_730_8,You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there    there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
meld_730_9,"Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!"
meld_730_10,But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...
meld_730_11,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go"
meld_730_12,Ok.
meld_730_13,You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
meld_731_0,"Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing."
meld_732_0,"Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire."
meld_732_1,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make    the right"

meld_733_12,Were still married! Dont tell Rachel. See you later.
meld_734_0,Hey! Are you okay?
meld_734_1,Fabulous.
meld_734_2,"Listen, drama critics theyre nothing but, but people who couldnt make it as actors. You know what you should do?"
meld_735_0,"Exactly. So you didnt, didnt mention anything to Issac right?"
meld_735_1,"Oh, well I tell Issac everything."
meld_735_2,"You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we havent actually met..."
meld_735_3,You dog!
meld_735_4,"Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend."
meld_735_5,"Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place."
meld_735_6,"Yeah, thats the one. Listen, I dont want to hurt her."
meld_735_7,"Oh, hey, man I know, doesnt matter how much we love em, monogamy is too cruel a rule."
meld_735_8,"Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?"
meld_735_9,"Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. Were the same, you and me."
meld_735_10,"Actually, no, were not."
meld_735_11,"Yeah, we are."
meld_735_12,"No, were not."
meld_735_13,"Yeah, we are."
meld_735_14,"No, were not!!"
meld_735_15,"Okay, were not."
meld_735_16,Right.
meld_735_17,"But, we are."
meld_735_18,Fine. I just need to know that youre not gonna tell your sister.
meld_735_19,I can promise not to tell her again.
meld_736_0,Emily!
meld_736_1,Oh my God! What are you doing here?
meld_736_2,"I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off."
meld_736_3,You are so sweet.
meld_736_4,"Thats, thats, thats a big candy bar. (Shes holding one of those huge"
meld_736_5,Me too.
meld_736_6,"Well, that me.  Here, have this.  Im only allowed one piece of carryon anyway."
meld_736_7,"Wait uh, listen."
meld_736_8,"I-I, I have to tell you something."
meld_736_9,"Umm, Ive been thinking, Im just gonna come out and say it."

meld_736_11,"I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you."
meld_736_12,Oh.  Thank you.
meld_736_13,Thats no problem.
meld_737_0,Monica!
meld_737_1,Shes sleeping.
meld_737_2,"I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was"
meld_737_3,Deep Impact
meld_737_4,"Sorry, I justcant sleep."
meld_737_5,Ooh!
meld_737_6,"Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it?"
meld_737_7,Because every time I look at that cover Im like
meld_737_8,It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
meld_738_0,"Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section"
meld_738_1,Yeah?
meld_738_2,Look at this.
meld_738_3,"Oh, it looks like mom and dads house."
meld_738_4,"Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic isOh my God!"
meld_738_5,What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
meld_738_6,I cant believe mom and dad are selling the house!
meld_738_7,I cant believe they-they didnt even tell us!
meld_738_8,I cant believe I still dont know what happened to the
meld_739_0,Nothing?

meld_739_13,And-and-and I wrote a song for us!
meld_739_14,"(Singing, to the tune of"
meld_739_15,That's okay.
meld_739_16,But you haven't even heard the chorus!
meld_740_0,"Well, shell understand right? Its not like I did it on purpose."
meld_740_1,"Dad, that wont matter to her."
meld_740_2,"Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff!"
meld_740_3,"See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her."
meld_740_4,"Oh my God, does she really thinks that?"
meld_740_5,"Well, can you blame her?"
meld_740_6,"Well I dont know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could"
meld_740_7,"Dad, dad I dont want to hear about it."
meld_740_8,Really?
meld_740_9,"Well, not right now."
meld_740_10,"Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, were gonna give her some!"

meld_741_0,"Yknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want."
meld_741_1,You could?
meld_741_2,Yeah! Ive been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
meld_741_3,Your own boat?
meld_741_4,What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
meld_742_0,Hes coming here for Thanksgiving!
meld_743_0,Count in our heads as-as good
meld_743_1,I guess I'm done.
meld_743_2,Fun’s over
meld_743_3,"Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!"
meld_743_4,I think I'm gonna take-off.
meld_743_5,"Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!  Ohhh!"
meld_744_0,Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it
meld_744_1,"Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you."
meld_744_2,"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
meld_744_3,Do you want a date Saturday?
meld_744_4,Yes please.
meld_744_5,"Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-"

meld_745_3,Hey!
meld_745_4,Hey.
meld_745_5,"Hey, man. What's up?"
meld_745_6,Maybe you can tell me.
meld_745_7,My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today.
meld_745_8,The first good thing she gets me in weeks.
meld_745_9,How could you not give me the message?
meld_745_10,"Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
meld_745_11,"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!"
meld_746_0,"See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed."
meld_747_0,Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
meld_747_1,Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
meld_747_2,Theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me.

meld_747_12,Am I giving out some kind ofsexy professor vibe?
meld_747_13,Not right now.
meld_747_14,It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
meld_747_15,"Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!"
meld_747_16,I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard!
meld_747_17,Yknow youI couldnt concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
meld_747_18,"I mean come on, you remember whats its like to be 19 and in love."
meld_748_0,Oh yes! Thank you very much!  Oh thats-thats actually how the French drink it.
meld_749_0,A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man!  Yes!
meld_749_1,Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!

meld_753_0,"Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm"
meld_753_1,G.I. Joe
meld_753_2,"Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!"
meld_754_0,"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid."
meld_754_1,"That, that's what's stupid."
meld_754_2,"I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers."
meld_754_3,"And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff."
meld_754_4,Down at the docks again?
meld_755_0,"Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?"
meld_755_1,Im not gonna tell you! Youre the bad man who broke Sarahs leg.
meld_755_2,"Hey now! That was an accident, okay."
meld_755_3,Youre a big scrud.
meld_755_4,Whats a scrud?
meld_755_5,"Why dont you look in the mirror, scrud."
meld_755_6,I dont have too. I can just look at you.
meld_755_7,"All right girls, and man. Lets see your final tallies.  Ohhhh, Debbie,  321 boxes of cookies,  Very nice."
meld_755_8,Not nice enough.
meld_755_9,"Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good."
meld_756_0,"So, howd the lasagne go over?"
meld_756_1,Really?!
meld_756_2,Good.
meld_756_3,So you owe me three pretty things.
meld_756_4,"Yeah, Ive been thinking a lot about you too."
meld_756_5,Its hard this whole platonic thing.
meld_756_6,Its a word!
meld_756_7,"Yeah, I do think its better this way.  Yeah, were being smart.   Yes, Im sure."
meld_756_8,You really sure?
meld_756_9,Ill call you back.
meld_757_0,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
meld_757_1,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him."
meld_757_2,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together."
meld_757_3,"But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary."
meld_757_4,I am
meld_757_5,I think you're better than you think you are.
meld_757_6,"Really? Okay, so"
meld_757_7,Know when to stop.
meld_757_8,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
meld_757_9,"Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance."
meld_757_10,Right!
meld_758_0,"Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!"
meld_758_1,Hey!-Hey! Whats going on?
meld_758_2,She broke my arm.
meld_758_3,He touched my fanny.
meld_758_4,"No, she touched mine first!"
meld_758_5,Thats my job!
meld_759_0,Are you being British?!
meld_759_1,No. Not anymore.
meld_759_2,Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
meld_759_3,"Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party."
meld_759_4,Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
meld_759_5,"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
meld_759_6,Where is this party?
meld_759_7,Here in Chelsea.
meld_759_8,Who's party is it?
meld_759_9,A woman's
meld_759_10,What woman?!
meld_759_11,Chelsea.
meld_759_12,"Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet."
meld_759_13,"Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle."
meld_759_14,So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
meld_759_15,Can I be that guy?
meld_760_0,Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
meld_760_1,"Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going."
meld_760_2,Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
meld_760_3,"Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you."
meld_760_4,"Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no!"
meld_761_0,Did you just flick me?
meld_761_1,"OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]"
meld_761_2,"Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!"
meld_761_3,Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!
meld_761_4,"OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass."
meld_761_5,Ow! Ow! Ow!
meld_761_6,"Alright, now I will let go if you both stop."
meld_761_7,Fine!
meld_761_8,Fine!
meld_761_9,"There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches."
meld_762_0,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own."
meld_762_1,Oh my God!
meld_762_2,Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I
meld_762_3,"Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on."
meld_762_4,"I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges."
meld_763_0,Hi.
meld_763_1,Hi.
meld_763_2,"Hi, listen, Im sorry about before."
meld_763_3,I dont need to have a game room.
meld_763_4,"I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnt get girls, and now I"
meld_763_5,Stop it Chandler.  Im sorry too.
meld_763_6,Really?
meld_763_7,Yeah! Oh yes!
meld_763_8,Ohh.
meld_763_9,"Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together."
meld_763_10,Thats a great idea! We can
meld_764_0,Totally!
meld_765_0,We dont have to come up with this now.
meld_765_1,Oh good.
meld_766_0,"Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover."
meld_766_1,Thats great. Good for you guys.
meld_766_2,I am not high maintenance!
meld_766_3,I am not a pushover!
meld_766_4,Who said you were?
meld_766_5,You did!
meld_766_6,"Oh, Im flaky. Ill say anything."
meld_767_0,"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."
meld_767_1,That does not sound stupid to me.
meld_767_2,"You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?"
meld_767_3,"I'm sorry, that's all the time we have."
meld_767_4,Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
meld_767_5,What uh-oh?
meld_767_6,"Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done."

meld_767_8,The laundry song that we sing.
meld_767_9,"Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
meld_767_10,"Ross, what's the matter?"
meld_767_11,"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
meld_768_0,Why are you here?
meld_768_1,"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we..."
meld_768_2,"No no no... I mean,"
meld_768_3,Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in    a cup!  Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .
meld_768_4,What!?
meld_768_5,This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
meld_768_6,"I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date..."
meld_768_7,Please... go!  Just let me know if you    need a hand!
meld_768_8,I think it just fell off.
meld_769_0,"I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!"
meld_769_1,And I just want a million dollars!
meld_769_2,Rachel?!

meld_770_1,"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em!"
meld_770_2,And we're not a couple of suckers!
meld_770_3,"I hear ya, Mugsy!"
meld_770_4,"But look, all these rooms are fine okay?"
meld_770_5,"Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you."
meld_770_6,"Okay,"
meld_770_7,Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
meld_770_8,Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
meld_770_9,"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
meld_770_10,"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!"
meld_770_11,"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?"
meld_770_12,"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
meld_770_13,Do not speak ill of the dead.
meld_770_14,"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?"
meld_770_15,"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom."
meld_770_16,What did you say?
meld_770_17,"I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn."""
meld_771_0,"Yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again."
meld_771_1,"Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Yknow, technically we still"
meld_771_2,"Im gonna go to the bathroom, maybe Ill see you there in a bit?"

meld_771_8,"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, yknow, you think Ill ever get there?"
meld_771_9,Yes.
meld_771_10,Thanks man.
meld_771_11,Okay man.
meld_771_12,But what about how much taller he is than me?
meld_771_13,"I mean, theres no way I can make myself taller now, yknow?"
meld_771_14,"And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?"
meld_771_15,"Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour."
meld_771_16,I know!
meld_771_17,"Had the beef-tips, huh?"
meld_772_0,"Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady."
meld_772_1,Not so fast Wesley!
meld_772_2,Ramoray!
meld_772_3,"Thats right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, youre not a real doctor! And that womans brain, is fine!"
meld_772_4,Oh! Thank God!

meld_773_2,Men are here.
meld_774_0,"Mom, would you relax."
meld_774_1,"That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that."
meld_774_2,"Mom, c'mon, stop worrying."
meld_774_3,"This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing"
meld_774_4,Hi.
meld_774_5,"Hi, hi can I help you?"

meld_775_6,"Pheebs, what about you?"
meld_775_7,Oh... Milwaukee.
meld_775_8,Um... Ross?
meld_775_9,"Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'"
meld_775_10,No way!
meld_775_11,The ride broke down.
meld_775_12,"So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom."
meld_775_13,"Oh, Rachel."
meld_776_0,Hey!
meld_776_1,Hey!
meld_776_2,"Oh, is the play over?"

meld_777_2,"Ross, yknow if you ever decide you need to redecorateAnd I think that you should."
meld_777_3,"You should, you should ask Rachel to help."
meld_777_4,Oh honey he doesnt need my help.
meld_777_5,"Oh, come on! I think hes ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk."
meld_777_6,Really?!
meld_777_7,"Hey, yknow what?"
meld_777_8,"Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff."
meld_777_9,"Yknow what? I dont, I dont think Phoebe really wants to come."
meld_777_10,No! I do want to!
meld_777_11,"Oh, she does want to."
meld_777_12,She does want to.
meld_777_13,Yeah!
meld_778_0,"Wow, you have really pretty feet."
meld_778_1,These old things.
meld_778_2,"Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, its been killing me today."
meld_778_3,"You mean theOkay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion."
meld_778_4,Yeah.
meld_778_5,"Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get yknow, real  nice and tight."
meld_778_6,"So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area."

meld_780_4,"You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters...."
meld_780_5,What?
meld_780_6,"One more chance Ursula, please?"
meld_780_7,Okay.

meld_782_3,"Hi! All right, lets go shoppin!!"
meld_782_4,"Um, y'know, before we go ah, theres something I need to say."
meld_782_5,"Oh, okay."
meld_782_6,"Ive kinda of had this ah, this crush on you."
meld_782_7,"But since you were with Ross, I-I didnt do anything about it."
meld_782_8,"But, now that youre not, Id really like to ask you out sometime."
meld_782_9,"So-so thats-thats what Im doing, now."
meld_782_10,Wow! Umm....
meld_782_11,I dropped a cup.
meld_783_0,"Hello, tiny embryos."
meld_783_1,"Well, Im-Im Phoebe Buffay, hi!"
meld_783_2,Im-Im-Im hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months.
meld_783_3,"You should know, that were doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, youve been there!"
meld_783_4,"Umm, yknow they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on."
meld_783_5,"Okay, and-and I promise that Ill keep you safe and warm until youre ready to have them take you home, so Oh!"
meld_783_6,"And also, umm next time you see me, Im screaming, dont worry, thats whats supposed to happen."
meld_783_7,Ready?
meld_783_8,Uh-huh.  Good luck.
meld_784_0,Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
meld_784_1,"Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so"
meld_785_0,I'm not your brother.
meld_785_1,What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!
meld_786_0,Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
meld_786_1,Are you kidding me?!
meld_786_2,It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!
meld_786_3,I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy!
meld_787_0,"Hey Joey, I got some beer for you."
meld_787_1,"Uh, don't you mean ""for whom?"""

meld_787_7,I'm lovable.
meld_787_8,Clearly there's a vibe going on between us.
meld_787_9,"But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road."
meld_787_10,Joey...
meld_788_0,"Oh no its not, no its not. Its a first date. Im"
meld_788_1,"Ho-oh, hes gonna get some!"
meld_788_2,Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment.
meld_788_3,"Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister."
meld_788_4,"Well, Im off to bed!"
meld_789_0,You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
meld_789_1,"Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny."
meld_789_2,"No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!"
meld_789_3,"Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk."
meld_789_4,Okay?
meld_789_5,"Umm, look I like you."
meld_789_6,"I-I really do, I like you a lot."
meld_789_7,Okay?
meld_789_8,"But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very"
meld_789_9,"Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!"
meld_790_0,"Oh, Joey! Sorry!"
meld_791_0,They made you head of the department!
meld_791_1,"No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didnt I get head of the department?"
meld_791_2,"Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm"
meld_791_3,Yeah.
meld_791_4,"I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?"

meld_791_6,"Ooh, great! Thanks!"
meld_791_7,"Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the"
meld_791_8,"You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, Ill tell ya"
meld_791_9,"Ooh, I miss dating."
meld_791_10,Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.
meld_791_11,"Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun!"
meld_791_12,I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
meld_791_13,"Hey, yknow what?"
meld_791_14,Huh?
meld_791_15,Why dont I take you out?
meld_791_16,"What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady."
meld_791_17,Yes I do!
meld_791_18,"And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out"
meld_791_19,Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill go with ya.
meld_791_20,Ill be fun.
meld_791_21,All right?
meld_792_0,Hi!
meld_792_1,Hey!
meld_792_2,"Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking"
meld_792_3,"Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good"
meld_792_4,"God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!"
meld_792_5,"Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me?"
meld_792_6,"Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress."
meld_792_7,"Oh, all right, I can ask Monica."
meld_792_8,"Oh screw her, that part is mine!"
meld_792_9,"Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here."
meld_792_10,"Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here."
meld_792_11,I can't believe you married him.
meld_792_12,But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a
meld_792_13,So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
meld_792_14,It's over! You
meld_792_15,How can I?
meld_792_16,"Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?"
meld_792_17,How can I accept that...
meld_792_18,I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
meld_792_19,Kiss me.
meld_792_20,What?
meld_793_0,"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?"
meld_793_1,The bigger half.
meld_793_2,I'd like to propose a toast.
meld_793_3,"Little toast here, ding ding."
meld_793_4,"I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting."
meld_793_5,"Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?"
meld_793_6,So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

meld_796_2,"It’s a funny story, actually."
meld_796_3,"I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really  know what I was saying."
meld_796_4,You fell asleep?
meld_796_5,"But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny?"
meld_796_6,Irony?
meld_796_7,"Not a fan, alright ."

meld_797_6,"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
meld_797_7,Oh. Thanks.
meld_797_8,"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing"

meld_798_6,Oh my.
meld_799_0,"Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot."
meld_799_1,"Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun."
meld_799_2,"Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles."
meld_799_3,Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
meld_799_4,"My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally."
meld_799_5,"No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now."
meld_799_6,Tho?
meld_800_0,Ohhh.
meld_800_1,"That's good, have a seat."
meld_801_0,"Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle."

meld_803_2,"Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay?"
meld_803_3,Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
meld_803_4,"Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity!"
meld_803_5,Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
meld_803_6,That means nothing to me.  Come on!
meld_804_0,"Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger."

meld_804_9,"Okay, Im sorry."
meld_805_0,Hello!
meld_805_1,What's this?
meld_805_2,Oh right its that girl's phone number.
meld_805_3,"Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me."
meld_805_4,"It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa!"
meld_805_5,"Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!"
meld_805_6,"Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it."
meld_805_7,Thank you.
meld_806_0,I dont know how any of these got opened?!
meld_806_1,You opened them all?

meld_806_3,Oh hey! You got my parents gift!
meld_806_4,Yeah. What is that?

meld_806_14,Im not?
meld_806_15,Listen I uh  Its a scary world out there especially if youre a single mom.
meld_806_16,"Yknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond."
meld_806_17,"So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?"
meld_807_0,Thank you.
meld_807_1,If I cant have it you cant have it!
meld_808_0,"I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical."
meld_808_1,"Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget."
meld_808_2,"There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and"

meld_813_2,"Okay, but there"
meld_813_3,I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!
meld_813_4,I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
meld_813_5,And did you?!
meld_813_6,"No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs."
meld_813_7,But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.

meld_817_6,"Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard."
meld_817_7,Would you stop that!
meld_817_8,Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?

meld_818_2,"I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd."
meld_818_3,Listen.
meld_818_4,"As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing."
meld_818_5,"I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you."
meld_818_6,"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked."
meld_818_7,"Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.."
meld_819_0,No-no-no-no.  Hey!
meld_819_1,"Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye."
meld_819_2,Hey sweetie.
meld_819_3,"Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?"
meld_819_4,I cant tell you. Its a secret.
meld_819_5,Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
meld_819_6,Awww.  But still no.
meld_819_7,"No Im serious, we should tell each other"
meld_819_8,"Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at"

meld_820_4,Oh! You got it?!
meld_820_5,"Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good."

meld_821_2,Who?
meld_821_3,"Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyones name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames."
meld_821_4,Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
meld_821_5,"Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?"
meld_821_6,"Umm, no. No."
meld_821_7,Yes you did! What was it?
meld_821_8,"Umm, its Cutie McPretty."

meld_821_10,"Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-Im having a great time!"
meld_821_11,"Yknow how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but its not."

meld_823_5,"Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that."
meld_823_6,"Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything."
meld_823_7,You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
meld_823_8,"What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?"
meld_823_9,"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
meld_823_10,What are you saying I should do?
meld_823_11,"I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him."
meld_823_12,"Thank you, Monica."
meld_823_13,"Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes."
meld_823_14,"Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine."

meld_828_13,"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine."
meld_828_14,"Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it."
meld_828_15,"Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it."
meld_829_0,Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
meld_829_1,"Well, I think this is a great place to work!"
meld_829_2,"Ok, are they listening?"

meld_831_4,"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time."

meld_832_7,"Oh, which museum?"
meld_832_8,"No, answer his."
meld_832_9,"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars."
meld_832_10,She was totally at my mercy.
meld_832_11,Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
meld_832_12,"No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie."
meld_832_13,"She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away."
meld_832_14,How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany.
meld_832_15,"Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now?"
meld_833_0,"No, there is no way! It can"

meld_834_1,"So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell a story?"
meld_834_2,"Oh, yeah, sure."
meld_834_3,"I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, Where are they, where are they?"
meld_834_4,"Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that."
meld_834_5,"Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?"
meld_834_6,Yeah.
meld_834_7,"You see, now, I would date this girl."
meld_834_8,"Shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire."
meld_834_9,"I mean, thats got to come in handy"
meld_834_10,"Okay, Ive got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?"
meld_834_11,I dont know.
meld_834_12,Me neither.

meld_836_4,"Hey, what time is it?"
meld_836_5,2:17.
meld_836_6,"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?"
meld_836_7,Are you serious?!
meld_836_8,Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
meld_836_9,Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
meld_836_10,"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
meld_836_11,"Hey, you guys"

meld_839_1,Youre making one right now!
meld_839_2,And-
meld_839_3,"Yeah, can I help you with something?"
meld_839_4,"Look, Im talking right now! Youreyou mean her."
meld_839_5,"Yknow, twin stuff is always a real big seller."
meld_839_6,What?!
meld_839_7,"Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars."
meld_839_8,No!!

meld_839_12,And shame on you!
meld_839_13,And shame on all of you!
meld_839_14,Youre disgusting!
meld_839_15,Especially you  with that!
meld_840_0,Hey!
meld_840_1,Hi Pheebs!
meld_840_2,Are you moving out?
meld_840_3,"No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's."
meld_840_4,"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
meld_840_5,"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
meld_840_6,"Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,"
meld_840_7,"Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs..."
meld_840_8,"Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me."
meld_840_9,"One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world."
meld_840_10,"Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!"
meld_840_11,"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies"
meld_840_12,"All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had."
meld_840_13,Which proves that I never lie.
meld_840_14,I guess you don't.
meld_840_15,Paolo made a pass at me.
meld_841_0,"Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out."
meld_841_1,Im not freaking out.
meld_841_2,Why would I be freaking out?
meld_841_3,"A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday."
meld_841_4,"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!"
meld_841_5,"I mean, whats the harm in that?"
meld_841_6,Right here!
meld_841_7,"Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel"
meld_841_8,Phoebe and Rachel!
meld_841_9,"So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!"
meld_841_10,"It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt."
meld_841_11,Okay.
meld_841_12,Really?
meld_841_13,"Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready"
meld_841_14,I know! I know.
meld_841_15,Okay.
meld_841_16,Im gonna go tell Joey that  that youre back. I was really worried about you.
meld_841_17,"Hey, did she buy it?"
meld_841_18,Totally.
meld_841_19,So did Heldi show you the place?
meld_841_20,"Yeah, its beautiful."
meld_841_21,I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!
meld_841_22,I know.
meld_842_0,"Okay look, I have an idea."
meld_842_1,"Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him."
meld_842_2,And then whoever does gets the phone.
meld_842_3,"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom."
meld_842_4,"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
meld_842_5,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin."
meld_842_6,Did I use that already today? Im sorry.
meld_842_7,Joe.
meld_842_10,"Oh, I win! Hes got"
meld_842_11,So you dont know thats
meld_842_12,His new girlfriend!
meld_843_0,I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
meld_843_1,"I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding."
meld_843_2,Shes saving the rest for her divorce.
meld_843_3,And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to
meld_843_4,Well what happened at dinner?
meld_843_5,My parents spent the money for our wedding!
meld_843_6,My God! What did you order?!
meld_843_7,"Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!"
meld_843_8,"Honey, its gonna be okay."
meld_843_9,No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
meld_843_10,"No, yknow what?"
meld_843_11,Its gonna be okay.
meld_843_12,I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast.
meld_843_13,Yknow?
meld_843_14,"And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack."
meld_844_0,"Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here."
meld_844_1,"Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle."
meld_844_2,"Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me."
meld_844_3,I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
meld_844_4,"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch."
meld_844_5,"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division."
meld_844_6,"Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"""
meld_844_7,"Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath."
meld_844_8,Im Ross!
meld_844_9,"Im divorced, and I have a kid!"
meld_844_10,Im Joey! Im an actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!
meld_844_11,"Im Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me."
meld_844_12,"All right, there you go!"
meld_844_13,"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!"
meld_844_14,"Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear."
meld_844_15,"Okay, good-good for you."
meld_844_16,"Im Rhonda,  and these arent real!"
meld_844_17,"Wow, Rhonda."
meld_844_18,Im Scott.
meld_844_19,"Yeah, okay, Scott!"
meld_844_20,And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
meld_845_0,So thanks for the warm welcome.
meld_845_1,"Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play."
meld_845_2,I hope you do too.
meld_845_3,"Now, lets go out there and get em!"
meld_845_4,"And remember, there is no I in team."
meld_845_5,"Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody"
meld_845_6,You! Chuckles! Whats your name?
meld_845_7,"Oh its Bing, sir. Im sorry , I was just ah..."
meld_845_8,"No-no, I heard what you said, funny."
meld_845_9,I like funny.
meld_845_10,"This team is about hard work, but its also about having fun."
meld_845_11,Good to have you aboard Bing!
meld_846_0,Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
meld_846_1,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?"
meld_846_2,They're gonna call her Chandler.
meld_846_3,"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?"
meld_846_4,Works on you.
meld_847_0,"Oh, that is so sweet."
meld_847_1,"No, no, ok, you hang up."
meld_847_2,"Ok, ok, one, two, three."
meld_847_3,Well you didn't hang up either.

meld_848_0,"Ross, hi, it's Rachel."
meld_848_1,"I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your"
meld_848_2,"Rach, I got a message from you."
meld_848_3,Oh my God.
meld_848_4,"Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the."
meld_848_5,You're over me?

meld_848_8,"Ohh, ohh."
meld_848_9,"When, when were you... under me?"
meld_848_10,"Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
meld_848_11,"OK, I need to lie down."
meld_849_0,"Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!"
meld_849_1,Really? That's great!
meld_849_2,"I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her"
meld_849_3,(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of
meld_849_4,"Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,"
meld_849_5,"Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one."
meld_849_6,Ben is way cuter than that kid.
meld_849_7,"I mean look at him, look at you,"
meld_849_8,"That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?"
meld_849_9,"Joey, you look nothing like Ben."
meld_849_10,I look more like him than you do!
meld_849_11,"Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that."
meld_850_0,That really was some of your best work.
meld_850_1,"Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work."
meld_850_2,I have to be up in seven minutes.
meld_850_3,"Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes"
meld_850_4,Really?!
meld_850_5,Do you wanna?
meld_850_6,Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!
meld_851_0,Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
meld_851_1,Boyfriend?
meld_851_2,No.
meld_851_3,Im Joey.
meld_851_4,Kristen.
meld_851_5,"Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?"
meld_851_6,Kristen.
meld_851_7,Got it!  So
meld_851_8,"So uh, do you live around here?"
meld_851_9,Yeah!
meld_851_10,Yeah!
meld_851_11,Right down there.
meld_851_12,Hey listen.. let me give you a little tip.
meld_851_13,Do not take a nap on this stoop  or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
meld_851_14,Ill remember that.
meld_851_15,"Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?"
meld_851_16,"Oh I, I have plans tonight."
meld_851_17,But how about tomorrow?
meld_851_18,"Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?"
meld_851_19,"You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the boxes."
meld_851_20,"Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, Ill grab this one."
meld_852_0,Hey.
meld_852_1,"Listen, um..."
meld_852_2,I'm sorry.
meld_852_3,": Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'"
meld_852_4,"That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!"
meld_852_5,"Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
meld_852_6,"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
meld_852_7,"Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me."
meld_852_8,"You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over."
meld_853_0,"By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me."
meld_853_1,"Oh, hello liar."
meld_853_2,"Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike."
meld_853_3,I couldve been killed I hope you know!
meld_853_4,"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were"
meld_853_5,"Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects."
meld_853_6,Phoebe.
meld_853_7,What?!  What the hell?!
meld_853_8,"All right, yknow what?"
meld_853_9,"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back."
meld_853_10,What?! Why?!
meld_853_11,"Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar"
meld_853_12,"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay."
meld_853_13,Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy.
meld_853_14,Okay Ross!  Please dont die!
meld_854_0,How could you have kept all of this from me?
meld_854_1,"I was going to tell you, but"
meld_854_2,But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
meld_854_3,Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that?
meld_854_4,Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.
meld_854_5,"No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down."
meld_855_0,Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!
meld_855_1,"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?"
meld_855_2,"Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl."
meld_855_3,"Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?"
meld_855_4,You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.
meld_855_5,"Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it."
meld_855_6,Why did you take the shower curtain down?
meld_855_7,That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.
meld_856_0,Hi.
meld_856_1,"Hey man, how did the audition go?"
meld_856_2,Estelle said I didn't get it.
meld_856_3,What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
meld_856_4,"Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me."
meld_857_0,No!
meld_857_1,"For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around."
meld_857_2,"No, from now on, Im staying in one place."
meld_857_3,Right here.
meld_857_4,"Well, its getting late."
meld_857_5,"Yeah, were gonna go."
meld_857_6,"Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?"
meld_857_7,"Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York."
meld_857_8,"Yeah, its a very large plane."
meld_857_9,Thats cool.
meld_857_10,"But, well stay here with you."
meld_857_11,"Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt."
meld_858_0,"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood."
meld_858_1,Theyre not a couple!
meld_858_2,"Oh-okay, I get the game now."
meld_858_3,"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?"
meld_858_4,Oh yeah!
meld_858_5,"Well okay, so then youre fine."
meld_858_6,The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
meld_858_7,Okay?
meld_858_8,So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
meld_858_9,"Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble."
meld_858_10,Really?
meld_858_11,"Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?"
meld_858_12,No.
meld_858_13,Noooo!!
meld_859_0,"Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe!"
meld_859_1,"Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye."
meld_859_2,"Wait a second! So, whats new with you?"
meld_859_3,"Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week."
meld_860_0,And your breasts! Hmm!!!
meld_860_1,Okay.
meld_860_2,"Umm look, youre coming on a little strong."
meld_860_3,"But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together."
meld_860_4,"So, why dont we just start over okay?"
meld_860_5,And you can just tell me about yourself.
meld_860_6,All right.
meld_860_7,Okay.
meld_860_8,"I write erotic novels, for children."
meld_860_9,What?!
meld_860_10,Theyre wildly unpopular.
meld_860_11,Oh my God!
meld_860_12,"Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D."
meld_860_13,Wow! You do?
meld_860_14,"Yeah,  a Pretty Huge"
meld_860_15,All right.
meld_861_0,"So, uh, how's she doing?"
meld_861_1,The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
meld_861_2,"How-how are you, Mom?"
meld_861_3,"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?"
meld_861_4,What?
meld_861_5,What's different?
meld_861_6,Nothing.
meld_861_7,"Oh, maybe that's it."
meld_861_8,"She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
meld_861_9,"Okay, relax, relax."
meld_861_10,"We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover."
meld_861_11,Oh God!
meld_861_12,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
meld_861_13,Oh!
meld_861_14,"...Yeah, they were gross."
meld_861_15,"Oh, you know what I loved?"
meld_861_16,Her Sweet 'n' Los.
meld_861_17,How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
meld_861_18,"Not just restaurants, from our house."
meld_862_0,Maybe.
meld_862_1,You can't!
meld_862_2,Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.
meld_862_3,In the hall.
meld_863_0,"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping."
meld_863_1,But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.
meld_863_2,"Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."
meld_863_3,"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."
meld_863_4,That's a good one!
meld_863_5,"Hey, Joe."
meld_863_6,"Dad, Ronni's here."
meld_863_7,Huh?
meld_864_0,"So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal."
meld_864_1,Anything at all.
meld_864_2,But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
meld_864_3,"Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest."
meld_864_4,Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me!
meld_865_0,"Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah."
meld_865_1,Limited seating my ass. Lets see who made the cut.  Hi!
meld_865_2,Im Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
meld_865_3,Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A
meld_865_4,"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers."
meld_865_5,"So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?"
meld_865_6,"Okay, youre fine."
meld_866_0,"Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!"
meld_866_1,Youll see.
meld_866_2,"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen."
meld_866_3,"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles"
meld_866_4,"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go."
meld_866_5,"But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time."
meld_866_6,"Really, its fine, whatever you want."
meld_866_7,Its perfect.
meld_866_8,"And, I dont know, if it starts to rain"
meld_866_9,Well then well get wet.
meld_866_10,Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
meld_867_0,Coming.
meld_867_1,I have a bone to pick with you.
meld_867_2,Uh-oh.
meld_867_3,Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
meld_867_4,Oh yeah? Did he pull the old
meld_867_5,Thats right! Thats right!
meld_867_6,Oh that.
meld_867_7,Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them!
meld_868_0,Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!
meld_868_1,Okay.
meld_868_2,"And if it were true, how"
meld_868_3,Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.
meld_869_0,Mark's a genius!
meld_869_1,Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
meld_869_2,"Look, don't you see what's happening here."
meld_869_3,"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant."
meld_869_4,Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
meld_869_5,What am I going to do?
meld_869_6,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that."
meld_869_7,"All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits."
meld_869_8,I don't know you guys.
meld_869_9,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you."
meld_869_10,"And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'"
meld_869_11,"And before you know it, she's with him."
meld_869_12,"And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'"
meld_869_13,"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'"
meld_869_14,"And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'"
meld_869_15,"And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'"
meld_869_16,"And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'"
meld_869_17,He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
meld_870_0,"This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor."
meld_870_1,Great. Great.
meld_870_2,"Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking about this pretty loud."
meld_870_3,Ill be there.
meld_870_4,"Listen, I know this is your party, but Id really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there."
meld_870_5,"Yeah. Tell ya what, lets not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!"
meld_870_6,Okay! Well need a six-pack of
meld_870_7,"Hey guys, what are you doing?"
meld_871_0,"Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler."
meld_871_1,"Oh, come on!"
meld_871_2,"Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him."
meld_871_3,"Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there."
meld_871_4,"Well, Chandler will be there for you too."
meld_871_5,"I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there."
meld_871_6,"And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot."
meld_871_7,What do ya say? What do ya say?
meld_871_8,"Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names."
meld_871_9,"But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk."
meld_871_10,I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!
meld_872_0,"What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well."
meld_872_1,I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
meld_872_2,"Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar..."
meld_872_3,What's that supposed to mean?
meld_872_4,Nothing! It's an expression.
meld_872_5,No it's not.
meld_872_6,Don't listen to your mother.
meld_872_7,"You're independent, and you always have been!"
meld_872_8,"Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!"
meld_872_9,"And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles..."
meld_873_0,PBS Telethon.
meld_873_1,Hi Joey.
meld_873_2,Hey Pheebs!
meld_873_3,I
meld_873_4,"$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what"
meld_873_5,"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not"
meld_874_0,What kind of problem?
meld_874_1,"Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!"
meld_874_2,Oh my God!
meld_874_3,Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
meld_874_4,"Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag."
meld_874_5,I don't wanna give up the bag.
meld_874_6,I don't have to give up the bag!
meld_874_7,Do I Rach?
meld_874_8,"Oh, you think I should give up the bag!"
meld_874_9,"Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it"
meld_874_10,I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
meld_874_11,I can't believe I'm hearing this!
meld_874_12,Wait a minute!
meld_874_13,Wait a minute!
meld_874_14,"I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial."
meld_874_15,"Yeah umm, they're called wallets."
meld_875_0,I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
meld_875_1,"Okay, great."
meld_875_2,They say he's only got half a tank left.
meld_875_3,Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
meld_875_4,We're switching rooms again.
meld_875_5,What? Why?
meld_875_6,"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room."
meld_875_7,Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
meld_875_8,"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?"
meld_875_9,Uh-huh.
meld_875_10,Chandler!
meld_876_0,Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
meld_876_1,Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
meld_876_2,"Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?"
meld_877_0,Hey!
meld_877_1,"Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were coming."
meld_877_2,"Oh, I wouldnt miss this."
meld_877_3,"Well, Im very glad youre here."
meld_877_4,"Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!"
meld_878_0,Hey!
meld_878_1,Hey-hey.
meld_878_2,So are guys doing okay?
meld_878_3,"Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important."
meld_879_0,Do you have a minute?
meld_879_1,"Well yeah, sure, whats up?"
meld_879_2,I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.
meld_880_0,Oh really?!
meld_880_1,Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
meld_880_2,"Oh, did you not want people to know that?"
meld_881_0,But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay.
meld_882_0,Whys that?
meld_883_0,I dont think I should say.
meld_883_1,"Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things."
meld_883_2,Okay.
meld_883_3,Kay.
meld_883_4,Well
meld_883_5,Yeah.
meld_883_6,Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
meld_883_7,"Yeah, shes gay."
meld_884_0,Here you go.
meld_884_1,"Great! All right, so Ill call you later."
meld_884_2,Great!
meld_884_3,Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
meld_884_4,That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
meld_884_5,"Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer."
meld_884_6,"No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey."
meld_884_7,What?
meld_884_8,Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
meld_884_9,Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
meld_884_10,Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
meld_884_11,"Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you."
meld_884_12,What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
meld_884_13,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs."
meld_884_14,"But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you."
meld_884_15,You got all that from the back of her head?
meld_884_16,"All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane."
meld_884_17,Whos Elaine?
meld_885_0,Can you people not see me?!
meld_885_1,"So, will you talk to him?"
meld_885_2,I dont know Rach.
meld_885_3,"Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free"
meld_885_4,One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!
meld_886_0,Hey!
meld_886_1,Hi!
meld_886_2,"Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?"
meld_886_3,We need a porn break.
meld_886_4,"We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again."
meld_886_5,"Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?"
meld_886_6,Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
meld_886_7,"Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay."
meld_886_8,Hey!
meld_886_9,Hi!
meld_886_10,"Well, what-what cha got there?"
meld_886_11,"Oh this, well Im glad you asked."
meld_886_12,"Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?"
meld_886_13,Ahh!
meld_886_14,"Now, I know what youre thinking"
meld_886_15,Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
meld_886_16,"Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?"
meld_886_17,No!
meld_886_20,"Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives."
meld_886_21,"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan."
meld_886_22,Whats the second part of your plan?
meld_887_0,Yes thats right.
meld_887_1,Why?
meld_887_2,"I tired attacking two women, did not work."
meld_887_3,What?!
meld_887_4,"No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends."
meld_887_5,"In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them."
meld_887_6,"Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!"
meld_887_7,"Oh, no!"
meld_887_8,No-no!
meld_887_9,"No, I tired!"
meld_887_10,But I couldnt.
meld_887_11,Thats why Im here.
meld_887_12,Maybe we could attack them together?
meld_887_13,That-thats a no.
meld_888_0,"What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!"
meld_888_1,"Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!"
meld_888_2,I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
meld_888_3,"All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you."
meld_888_4,"No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything."
meld_888_5,No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
meld_888_6,I like that.
meld_888_7,"Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle."
meld_888_8,Huh?
meld_888_9,One swift kick and hell back off.
meld_888_10,"All right, bad ankle, got it!"
meld_888_11,"And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip."
meld_888_12,Yeah.
meld_888_13,"And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup."
meld_888_14,"Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!"
meld_888_15,"And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp."
meld_888_16,"But-but, Liams on my team."
meld_888_17,I dont care! You just get him!
meld_888_18,"Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!"
meld_888_19,The Red Ross! Okay.
meld_889_0,Oh!  Oh by the way?
meld_889_1,Uh-hmm.
meld_889_2,James Brolin?
meld_889_3,"Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay."
meld_889_4,Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
meld_889_5,Really?!
meld_890_0,Hello?
meld_890_1,"Hello, is Ross there?"
meld_890_2,"Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message?"
meld_890_3,"Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try."
meld_890_4,Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!!
meld_891_0,"Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!"
meld_891_1,Oh!  Shes growing inside you.
meld_891_2,Whoa!!
meld_891_3,Oh!
meld_891_4,Wow that was a big one.
meld_891_5,I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
meld_891_6,Oh hey you guys!
meld_892_0,"Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya.  What uhHow come youre not going?"
meld_892_1,I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
meld_892_2,I thought you already have a job.
meld_892_3,And people say you dont pay attention.
meld_892_4,"No, this is a much better job."
meld_892_5,Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
meld_892_6,Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
meld_892_7,Thats what I do now.
meld_892_8,"Hey Joey, come taste this."
meld_892_9,What is it?
meld_892_10,Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well  Im getting my revenge!
meld_892_11,You cooked him?
meld_892_12,No.
meld_892_13,"He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again."
meld_892_14,"Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!"
meld_892_15,"""Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."""
meld_892_16,"The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?"
meld_893_0,"So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?"
meld_893_1,"No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together."
meld_893_2,Were never gonna find anybody.
meld_893_3,Well then let me do it!
meld_893_4,Joe
meld_893_5,No-no-no!
meld_893_6,"Look, Ive been thinking about it."
meld_893_7,Im an actor right?
meld_893_8,So I wont get nervous talking in front of people.
meld_893_9,"I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts!"
meld_893_10,Everyone knows Im an ass man!
meld_893_11,That is true.
meld_893_12,"Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you."
meld_893_13,Itll be me!
meld_893_14,And I swear Ill do a really good job.
meld_893_15,"Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me."
meld_893_16,It might be kinda cool.
meld_893_17,So I can do it?
meld_894_0,Ah-ha! Too cocky!
meld_895_0,I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
meld_895_1,Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon as theyre done with it at the key shining place.
meld_895_2,What the hell is that?
meld_895_3,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?"
meld_895_4,You said there was a gas leak in here.
meld_895_5,Well why dont you use your key?
meld_895_6,"Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded."
meld_895_7,"If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions."
meld_895_8,Come on!
meld_895_9,Hurry up.
meld_895_10,Oh! We could have done that.
meld_896_0,"Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about."
meld_896_1,"Oh, Im so sorry."
meld_896_2,"Um, and maybe Im wrong!"
meld_896_3,"I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more."
meld_896_4,You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?
meld_896_5,"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat."
meld_897_0,"Oh, but its made her so happy."
meld_897_1,Little girl misses her cat.
meld_897_2,Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
meld_897_3,"Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her."
meld_897_4,Yeah.
meld_897_5,Thank you.
meld_897_6,I
meld_897_7,"He is right, isnt he?"
meld_897_8,"Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong."
meld_897_9,You think?
meld_897_10,"Oh-no, hes right."
meld_898_0,Seven hundred bucks!
meld_898_1,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
meld_898_2,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something."
meld_898_3,"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
meld_898_4,"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?"
meld_899_0,Oh.
meld_899_1,Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
meld_900_0,Me too.
meld_900_1,"Although this city is my home, so."
meld_900_2,"So thats dumb what I said, dont tell him I said that."
meld_900_3,"Umm, you make something up."
meld_900_4,"Nice,  thank you."
meld_900_5,This is me.
meld_900_6,Here.
meld_900_7,Your eyes are very pretty.
meld_900_8,"Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!"
meld_900_9,He would like to kiss you.
meld_900_10,"Okay, y'know what, you dont have to do that now."
meld_900_11,No-no-no-no!!
meld_900_12,"Not him, you dont!"
meld_900_13,Well the moments over.
meld_900_14,Oh.
meld_900_15,Oy!
meld_901_0,"Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?"
meld_901_1,Id really prefer a mountain bike.
meld_901_2,"Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me."
meld_901_3,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa."
meld_901_4,"Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum."
meld_901_5,"Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious."
meld_901_6,"Oh, you want something serious."
meld_901_7,"Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas."
meld_901_8,Those are dead serious.
meld_901_9,"All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever."
meld_901_10,"No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant."
meld_901_11,Why not?!
meld_901_12,"Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is..."
meld_901_13,What is the thing?
meld_901_14,"Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband."
meld_901_15,What?
meld_901_16,They were in his office.
meld_901_17,"Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me."
meld_902_0,Im telling you its like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
meld_902_1,Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk.
meld_902_2,Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
meld_902_3,How are you feeling?
meld_902_4,You are
meld_902_5,I really wish that you wouldnt.
meld_902_6,"Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?"
meld_902_7,"Then we can put you in bed, okay?"
meld_902_8,Just smile and dont talk to
meld_902_9,Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
meld_902_10,Pheebs!!
meld_902_11,Dont you see? Everyones looking at me! The plans working! I didnt even have to take off my top yet!
meld_902_12,Speech! Come on Monica!
meld_902_13,Come on!
meld_902_14,Come on! Speech!
meld_902_15,"Hey Chandler, you cant keep your hands off her for one second!"
meld_902_16,"Oh-ho, I think its nice."
meld_903_0,Well you have to because maybe its stupid.
meld_903_1,Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
meld_903_2,Oh crap!
meld_904_0,All right.
meld_904_1,The super couldnt figure out what it did.
meld_904_2,A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did.
meld_904_3,Ive had seven pretty serious shocks.
meld_904_4,I officially give up.
meld_904_5,Thank God.
meld_904_6,"I guess Joey was right, it does nothing."
meld_904_7,See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.
meld_905_0,Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
meld_905_1,He doesn't have anyone.
meld_905_2,"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible."
meld_905_3,I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
meld_905_4,"Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!"
meld_905_5,"Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing."
meld_905_6,You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
meld_905_7,"Y'know, we don't have to watch this."
meld_905_8,"No way, forget it."
meld_905_9,"C'mon, she's your mom!"
meld_905_10,Exactly.
meld_905_11,"Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!"
meld_905_12,I love her books!
meld_905_13,I cannot get on a plane without one!
meld_905_14,"I mean, this is so cool!"
meld_905_15,"Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
meld_905_16,"C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast."
meld_906_0,Thank you.
meld_906_1,And a nice hot cider for Monica.
meld_906_2,"Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?"
meld_906_3,Yeah?
meld_906_4,Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
meld_906_5,Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!
meld_907_0,"Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?"
meld_907_1,You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
meld_907_2,"Yeah I can, it worked real well."
meld_907_3,No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
meld_907_4,I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.
meld_907_5,Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
meld_907_6,What?!
meld_907_7,Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.
meld_907_8,Who are you talking too?
meld_907_9,"Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree."
meld_907_10,I am
meld_907_11,You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!
meld_907_12,I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
meld_907_13,"Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!"
meld_908_0,Shh! Get me out of here.
meld_908_1,Oh.
meld_908_2,Ross!
meld_908_3,What?
meld_908_4,"Come here, check this out!"
meld_908_5,What? Is it the comet?
meld_908_6,"No! No-no. Look, theres a bug stuck in tar right here."
meld_908_7,"Joey comeI cant believeI bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of natures most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!"
meld_908_8,"Yknow, theres"
meld_908_9,Show me where?
meld_908_10,Right-right up here.
meld_908_11,Joey wheres the pipe that was holding the door open?
meld_908_12,"I dont know!   Yeah, I do."
meld_908_13,Joey!
meld_908_14,What?! All rightHey! Dont look at me! Youre the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid
meld_908_15,"Its called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!"
meld_908_16,Oh no! No! No!
meld_909_0,Wow! This place is incredible!  Stings penthat he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway!
meld_909_1,Hi!
meld_909_2,Hi!
meld_909_3,Im Trudie.
meld_909_4,Uh-huh.
meld_909_5,You must be Bens mum.
meld_909_6,Why else would I be here?
meld_909_7,Do sit down.
meld_909_8,Yeah.
meld_910_0,Hi.. how was the game?
meld_910_1,Well..
meld_910_2,WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
meld_910_3,Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
meld_910_4,Alan.
meld_910_5,He was unbelievable.
meld_910_6,"He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-..."
meld_910_7,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team."
meld_910_8,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.."
meld_910_9,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
meld_910_10,What?
meld_910_11,"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
meld_910_12,"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
meld_910_13,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
meld_910_14,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
meld_911_0,"Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade,"
meld_911_1,"Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?"
meld_911_2,What the hell!
meld_911_3,Okay.
meld_911_4,"All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?"
meld_911_5,"Yeah, this was a stupid idea."
meld_912_0,My God!
meld_912_1,These pants are burning up!
meld_912_2,"Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!"
meld_912_3,What is she trying to kill me?
meld_912_4,It's like a volcano in here!
meld_912_5,Are you hot?
meld_912_6,"Okay, it must just be me then."
meld_912_7,"That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?"
meld_913_0,You're driving me crazy with that!
meld_913_1,"Okay, I'll stop."
meld_913_2,Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
meld_913_3,"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now."
meld_913_4,You wanna play?
meld_913_5,"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon."
meld_913_6,And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
meld_913_7,"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home."
meld_913_8,"All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?"
meld_913_9,I'm intrigued.
meld_913_10,"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid."
meld_913_11,"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back."
meld_913_12,"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts."
meld_913_13,Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
meld_913_14,"Uh yeah, right here."
meld_914_0,"Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?"
meld_914_1,What's that?
meld_914_2,"Weeeell, it's rum, and-"
meld_915_0,I'm sure they'll be here soon.
meld_915_1,"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
meld_915_2,Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
meld_915_3,You are really frightening me.
meld_915_4,"Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?"
meld_915_5,"All right, ten centimeters, here we go."
meld_915_6,"All right, honey, time to start pushing."
meld_915_7,But they're not here yet!
meld_915_8,"I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them."
meld_915_9,"Oh, god."
meld_916_0,"Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us."
meld_916_1,"Yeah, I-I think I suggested that."
meld_916_2,"Aw, we-we are so So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you."
meld_916_3,And I mean-Im having a lot of fun.
meld_916_4,Okay.
meld_916_5,"I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun."
meld_916_6,"Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right?"
meld_916_7,So where-where is it going?
meld_916_8,Ah!
meld_916_9,Thats-thats the real question.
meld_916_10,And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun.
meld_916_11,"Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger."
meld_916_12,"No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou"
meld_916_13,"Im sorry, so umm, so where are we?"
meld_917_0,Yknow what?
meld_917_1,I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.
meld_917_2,I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .
meld_917_3,No?
meld_917_4,Really?
meld_917_5,They taste so good.
meld_918_0,Drum roll.
meld_918_1,"Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?"
meld_918_2,"Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney."
meld_918_3,"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse."
meld_918_4,Youre actually going through with this?
meld_918_5,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life."
meld_918_6,"Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson."
meld_918_7,You got problems because of you!
meld_918_8,Not your name!
meld_918_9,"All right, this has got to stop!"
meld_918_10,Chandler is a great name!
meld_918_11,"In factyes,  Im, Im sorry."
meld_918_12,"I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler."
meld_919_0,Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
meld_919_1,It was.
meld_920_0,"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thats not gonna be me, not me."
meld_920_1,Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
meld_920_2,No.
meld_920_3,Whoa. That was really good.
meld_920_4,"Thanks, any suggestions?"
meld_921_0,You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!
meld_921_1,"Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and"
meld_921_2,You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!
meld_921_3,Well I was just so excited to see you.
meld_921_4,Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
meld_921_5,No-no its not!
meld_921_6,I dont want to lose you!
meld_921_7,Its-its like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was youYeah it is too weird.
meld_921_8,So I guess this is it.
meld_921_9,Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.
meld_921_10,"Yeah, so do you."
meld_922_0,Hey!
meld_922_1,Hi.
meld_922_2,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
meld_922_3,Manhattan does not have enough stores.
meld_922_4,"Well,"
meld_922_5,You can?
meld_922_6,Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
meld_922_7,Um-hmm.
meld_922_8,And a small piece of chocolate.
meld_923_0,Okay.
meld_923_1,"Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship"
meld_923_2,"I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!"
meld_923_3,Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
meld_923_4,"Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time."
meld_923_5,"I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!"
meld_923_6,Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?
meld_923_7,"No! No! Not, Paris."
meld_923_8,"Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?"
meld_923_9,"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!"
meld_923_10,When?
meld_923_11,I dont know exactly.
meld_923_12,"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes."
meld_923_13,But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
meld_924_0,"Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him!"
meld_924_1,Great! Go get him.
meld_924_2,"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first."
meld_924_3,Hes not really my type.
meld_924_4,"No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything."
meld_924_5,"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks."
meld_924_6,You do attract some stinkers.
meld_925_0,Chandler.
meld_925_1,"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a"
meld_925_2,"Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day."
meld_925_3,"Oh, listen."
meld_925_4,"If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them."
meld_925_5,Really.
meld_925_6,Nothing at all.
meld_925_7,Really.
meld_925_8,Nothing.
meld_926_0,"Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?"
meld_926_1,Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?
meld_926_2,"No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict."
meld_926_3,"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?"
meld_926_4,"No, no, I keep trying, yknow?"
meld_926_5,"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""go to the bathroom."""
meld_926_6,He may think Im sick.
meld_926_7,"Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!"
meld_926_8,"Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them."
meld_926_9,Thats it.
meld_926_10,"Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?"
meld_926_11,Pretty much.
meld_926_12,All right.
meld_926_13,Hey Monica!
meld_926_14,Hi!
meld_926_15,"Hey man, you feeling any better?"
meld_926_16,"Joey, we have something to tell you."
meld_926_17,Oh my God! Youre pregnant!
meld_927_0,"Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas."
meld_927_1,What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.
meld_927_2,Really?!
meld_927_3,Yeah!
meld_927_4,Oh my God!Eh! Well
meld_928_0,"You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn."
meld_928_1,Hes gonna go up to the counter with
meld_928_2,Yeah.
meld_928_3,I missed this.
meld_928_4,Me too.
meld_928_5,"So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?"
meld_929_0,Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
meld_929_1,"Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help."
meld_929_2,We will.
meld_929_3,"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles."
meld_929_4,"No Mon,"
meld_929_5,Every year.
meld_930_0,Hey! Ross!
meld_930_1,Die Hard
meld_930_2,"Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?"
meld_930_3,Whatd you rent?
meld_930_4,Die Hard 2
meld_930_5,"Joey, this is"
meld_930_6,"Oh, well we watch it a second time and its"
meld_930_7,"Joey, we"
meld_930_8,And?
meld_930_9,And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
meld_930_10,Die Hard
meld_930_11,"Dude, you didnt say"
meld_930_12,"Yeah, I just got uh, got plans."
meld_930_13,"Well, John McClane had plans!"
meld_930_14,"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch."
meld_930_15,What are you talking about? Bitch.
meld_931_0,I know you botched that operation on purpose.
meld_931_1,"I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder."
meld_931_2,I don't care if you    are my brother.
meld_932_0,"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!"
meld_932_1,Stop going through my stuff !
meld_932_2,Hey!
meld_932_3,Hey!
meld_932_4,"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey."
meld_932_5,"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea."
meld_932_6,"Please, what about you and Chandler?"
meld_932_7,That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
meld_932_8,Well hello !
meld_932_9,What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
meld_932_10,"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!"
meld_932_11,Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
meld_932_12,I'm gonna do it.
meld_932_13,And I can't stop you.
meld_932_14,No.
meld_932_15,"Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?"
meld_932_16,I'm smarter than
meld_933_0,"Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out."
meld_933_1,"Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up."
meld_933_2,"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there."
meld_933_3,"Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man."
meld_933_4,Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there.
meld_933_5,No.
meld_933_6,"No, thank you."
meld_933_7,"You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there."
meld_933_8,Id love an ice water.
meld_933_9,You got it.
meld_933_10,"Joey, what are you doing?"
meld_933_11,Just being friendly.
meld_933_12,"Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there."
meld_933_13,"Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther?"
meld_933_14,Dont wink at me. And put on your apron.
meld_933_15,"Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons."
meld_933_16,"Joey, do you work here?"
meld_933_17,No.
meld_933_18,"Hey, waiter."
meld_933_19,Yeah?
meld_934_0,"Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are."
meld_934_1,"Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum."
meld_934_2,Im calling for Monica Geller.
meld_934_3,"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available"
meld_934_4,"This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!"
meld_935_0,Thank you.
meld_935_1,Thanks.
meld_935_2,I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
meld_935_3,Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
meld_935_4,"This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again."
meld_935_5,So go fix it!
meld_935_6,Go find Chandler!
meld_935_7,He's probably up in your room!
meld_935_8,Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
meld_935_9,Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
meld_935_10,"Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!"
meld_935_11,Anybody lose this?
meld_935_12,Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
meld_935_13,Hmm.
meld_936_0,Do you remember where the duck food is?
meld_936_1,"Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?"
meld_936_2,Because Im going to London.
meld_936_3,What?! What do you mean youre going to London?
meld_936_4,"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him."
meld_936_5,"Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back."
meld_936_6,"IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!"
meld_936_7,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does."
meld_936_8,But I have to tell him how I feel!
meld_936_9,He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
meld_936_10,Thats not why youre going!
meld_936_11,"Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach."
meld_936_12,"Forget that British chippy."""
meld_936_13,OhhDo you think he will?!
meld_936_14,No!
meld_936_15,Because hes in love with the British chippy!
meld_936_16,"Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!"
meld_936_17,"Yknow, its too late!"
meld_936_18,You missed youre chance!
meld_936_19,"Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over."
meld_936_20,"Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, ""I do."""
meld_936_21,"I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter."
meld_937_0,So is everybody here?
meld_937_1,I got here a little early myself.
meld_937_2,Let us begin.
meld_937_3,"Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations."
meld_937_4,Here.
meld_937_5,Here.
meld_937_6,Now as for the hydrosaurs
meld_938_0,"Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night."
meld_938_1,"Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry."
meld_938_2,"So, do you think you can forgive me?"
meld_938_3,Great.
meld_938_4,Thanks.
meld_938_5,"Okay, bye."
meld_938_6,"Hello, Jennifer?"
meld_938_7,"Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?"
meld_938_8,"Oh, shes not home huh?"
meld_938_9,"Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too."
meld_939_0,Hey!
meld_939_1,Hi.
meld_939_2,Are you all right?
meld_939_3,Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
meld_939_4,Oh my God! He did it?
meld_939_5,Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
meld_939_6,Are you kidding?
meld_939_7,I’m like the one who talked him into it.
meld_939_8,I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
meld_939_9,And you really think this is a good idea?
meld_939_10,"I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people."
meld_939_11,I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.
meld_939_12,"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so."
meld_939_13,Really?! Even Ross?
meld_939_14,Especially Ross!
meld_939_15,"Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later."
meld_939_16,"Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll  come back."
meld_939_17,"There he goes, your fiancée."
meld_939_18,I guess so.
meld_939_19,Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
meld_939_20,I can’t say that I’m surprised.
meld_940_0,"Oh, that is so unfortunate."
meld_940_1,What?
meld_940_2,Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
meld_940_3,"Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone."
meld_940_4,You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.
meld_940_5,"Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye."
meld_940_6,Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out.
meld_940_7,"Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore."
meld_940_8,I think on some levels she already knows.
meld_941_0,Night Mon. Night Julio.
meld_941_1,Adiós.
meld_941_2,"Look Julio, someone left their book here."
meld_941_3,"Ah actually, that is mine."
meld_941_4,"Oh yeah, what are you reading?"
meld_941_5,"Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?"
meld_941_6,"Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?"
meld_941_7,"I thought I would, but the translation's no good."
meld_941_8,Your a poet and don't know it.
meld_941_9,"Actually I ah, I am a poet."
meld_941_10,"Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?"
meld_941_11,"Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip."
meld_941_12,Mine?  Right here?
meld_941_13,I can write an epic poem about this lip.
meld_941_14,"How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it."
meld_942_0,"Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal."
meld_942_1,What?
meld_942_2,"I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win."
meld_942_3,What?
meld_942_4,Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
meld_942_5,Are we really in Montreal?!
meld_942_6,"Yes we are. So, coffee?"
meld_942_7,"Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?"
meld_942_8,"Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia."
meld_943_0,"Okay, heres batch 22."
meld_943_1,"Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers."
meld_943_2,"This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg."
meld_943_3,Lets give it a shot.
meld_943_4,"Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?"
meld_943_5,"No, just a Friday night."
meld_944_0,Would she?
meld_944_1,Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
meld_945_0,"Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it."
meld_945_1,"I know honey, Im sorry."
meld_945_2,"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in."
meld_945_3,"Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!"
meld_945_4,"Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt...."
meld_945_5,"I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom."
meld_945_6,Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
meld_945_7,"Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah...."
meld_945_8,"Its not funny, this is actually my job."
meld_945_9,"Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus."
meld_945_10,"Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here."
meld_945_11,And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
meld_945_12,"Ah, just one other thing."
meld_945_13,Yes?!
meld_945_14,"I ah, I work at"
meld_945_15,Do you want my pickle?
meld_946_0,Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
meld_946_1,Why?
meld_946_2,"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
meld_946_3,Oh my God.
meld_946_4,Phoebe.
meld_946_5,"Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression."
meld_946_6,"Where?  Ooh, come to Momma."
meld_946_7,"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
meld_946_8,We should do something. Whistle.
meld_946_9,We are not going to whistle.
meld_946_10,"Come on, do it."
meld_946_11,No!
meld_946_12,Do it!
meld_946_13,No!
meld_946_14,Do it do it do it!
meld_946_15,Woo-woo!
meld_946_16,I can't believe you did that!
meld_947_0,"Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros."
meld_947_1,Still?
meld_947_2,"I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance."
meld_947_3,I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
meld_947_4,"Either eat it, or be in it."
meld_947_5,"Spoon?  So, what do you think?"
meld_947_6,"Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal."
meld_947_7,Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. theres a new class comin in.
meld_947_8,"Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?"
meld_947_9,I can.
meld_947_10,"Okay, go ahead."
meld_947_11,"Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon."
meld_947_12,"Thats very good, whats your name?"
meld_947_13,Monica.
meld_947_14,"Monica, you go to the head of the class."
meld_947_15,Okay.
meld_948_0,"And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen."
meld_948_1,But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.
meld_948_2,Human spleeeen.
meld_948_3,Olé!
meld_948_4,What are you doing here!
meld_948_5,"Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!"
meld_948_6,Great!
meld_948_7,Yeah!
meld_948_8,"It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!"
meld_948_9,"Yeah, ""You suck"" and ""shut up and go home""."
meld_948_10,Listen Phoebe...
meld_948_11,Yeah.
meld_948_12,"You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but..."
meld_948_13,But what?
meld_948_14,This is kind of a classy place.
meld_948_15,"Ok, say no more."
meld_949_0,"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."
meld_949_1,"Well, I've brought some books. We could read."
meld_949_2,"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet."
meld_949_3,Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
meld_949_4,"I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention"
meld_949_5,"Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?"
meld_949_6,We can't. We're not pharmacists!
meld_949_7,"I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba..."
meld_949_8,Kate Miller?
meld_949_9,Kate Miller it is.
meld_949_10,And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
meld_949_11,In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
meld_949_12,Thank you.
meld_950_0,Oh my God!
meld_950_1,"We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry."
meld_950_2,This year was supposed to be great!
meld_950_3,"But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!"
meld_950_4,"No. No, you're not a loser."
meld_950_5,Look at me!
meld_950_6,"Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!"
meld_950_7,"Oh, be-because of the leather pants."
meld_950_8,"See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something."
meld_950_9,That really is something.. that's really cool.
meld_950_10,Howdy partner!
meld_950_11,Maybe I should get another pair!
meld_950_12,"Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides."
meld_950_13,I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.
meld_950_14,I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
meld_950_15,I would make a good cowboy.
meld_950_16,"Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry."
meld_950_17,"Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep."

meld_953_6,"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!"
meld_953_7,"I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
meld_953_8,"Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps."

meld_953_19,"I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ..."
meld_953_20,"Oh my god, we killed Bob!"
meld_953_21,"Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse."

meld_954_2,"Oh yeah, no problem."
meld_954_3,Thanks.
meld_954_4,"Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection."
meld_954_5,Joey!
meld_955_0,What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
meld_955_1,"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!"
meld_955_2,"So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party."
meld_955_3,"I said, ""No!"""
meld_955_4,Which puts

meld_956_8,"No-no, they're not very nice people."
meld_956_9,"Okay, listen, I really like you."
meld_956_10,Okay?
meld_956_11,I think this can go somewhere.
meld_956_12,"So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?"

meld_959_1,"Anyway, she didnt want to stay."
meld_959_2,I called a cab. she just left.
meld_959_3,I wrote you a letter.
meld_959_4,Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
meld_959_5,Its just some things Ive been thinking about.

meld_963_7,You didnt just break up.
meld_963_8,"Hey, its been like three weeks!"

meld_966_3,Ohh!
meld_966_4,Okay!

meld_969_0,Yeah!
meld_969_1,"Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, yknow?"
meld_969_2,"Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him."
meld_969_3,Oh wow thats a great idea! And
meld_969_4,Here you go.
meld_969_5,"Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one."

meld_972_4,Oh right.
meld_972_5,Right.
meld_972_6,"Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried?"
meld_972_7,Were probably too old to do that now.
meld_972_8,"Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all of these freckles."
meld_972_9,Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related.
meld_972_10,"It took you that long to figure it out, huh?"
meld_972_11,"Well Im, Im a little slow.  Just as our children would be."
meld_973_0,Relax every muscle in your body.
meld_973_1,Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
meld_973_2,"Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place."
meld_973_3,"Okay, tell me your happy place."
meld_973_4,"Richard's living room, drinking wine."
meld_973_5,"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!"
meld_973_6,"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
meld_973_7,"Well, okay, fine, use my happy place."
meld_973_8,"Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything."
meld_973_9,"All right, I'll try not to."
meld_973_10,"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
meld_973_11,Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
meld_973_12,"All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
meld_973_13,"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
meld_973_14,"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place."
meld_973_15,Okay.
meld_973_16,"Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains."
meld_973_17,And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
meld_973_18,"Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee."
meld_974_0,"OK sweetie, I'll see you later."
meld_974_1,See you later Rach.
meld_975_0,Bye-bye Julie.
meld_975_1,Hey.
meld_975_2,Hey.
meld_975_3,"Hey, c'mon, cut it out."
meld_975_4,Hey?
meld_975_5,What?
meld_975_6,Can I ask you somethin'?
meld_976_0,"Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower."
meld_976_1,Ok.
meld_976_2,"Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?"
meld_976_3,What's up?
meld_976_4,F.Y.I..
meld_976_5,I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.
meld_976_6,Her name is Stephanie... something.
meld_976_7,She's supposed to be very good.
meld_976_8,But what about Phoebe?
meld_976_9,"Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around."
meld_976_10,"Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her."
meld_976_11,Uh...
meld_976_12,"Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?"
meld_977_0,"Ahh, no."
meld_977_1,Oh.
meld_977_2,Are you jealous?
meld_977_3,"Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all."
meld_977_4,I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
meld_977_5,You are totally jealous.
meld_977_6,I'm not jealous.
meld_977_7,"All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers."
meld_977_8,"And y'know, and um, I..."
meld_977_9,"Honey, I love you too."
meld_977_10,"Ugh. Wait, wait, wait."
meld_977_11,What?
meld_977_12,Huh.
meld_977_13,"Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know."
meld_977_14,"Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper."
meld_978_0,I cant believe you came back.
meld_978_1,Dont say anything.
meld_978_2,"I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think."
meld_978_3,"I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now."
meld_978_4,Rachel! Rachel!
meld_978_5,What?
meld_978_6,You missed the exit!
meld_978_7,"Oh, sorry."
meld_978_8,"My God, what were you thinking about?"
meld_978_9,"Um,  Barry."
meld_978_10,Awwwww
meld_979_0,"I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!"
meld_979_1,Dude!
meld_979_2,And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
meld_979_3,God!
meld_979_4,All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
meld_979_5,"Well actually, Ross doesn't."
meld_979_6,"Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
meld_980_0,Dear Mary-Angela.
meld_980_1,Hi.
meld_980_2,How?s it going.
meld_980_3,This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.
meld_980_4,What the hell?s a matter with you?
meld_980_5,How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
meld_980_6,"Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba."
meld_980_7,"All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person."
meld_980_8,At least you know her name.
meld_980_9,"You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy."
meld_980_10,What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
meld_980_11,Where in Cuba?
meld_981_0,Hey.
meld_981_1,"You uh, you may have been right about Jill."
meld_981_2,Oh! I knew it! What happened?
meld_981_3,"Umm, she kissed me."
meld_981_4,What?! You kissed!
meld_982_0,All right.
meld_982_1,"Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?"
meld_982_2,A two and a five.
meld_982_3,"Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!"
meld_982_4,Really?!
meld_982_5,"Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got?"
meld_982_6,A four and a nine.
meld_982_7,Youre kidding right?
meld_982_8,No. Why?
meld_982_9,Well thats a full cup!
meld_982_10,Damn! I am good at Cups!
meld_983_0,What? Why? Where are you?
meld_983_1,Im still on the set!
meld_983_2,Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
meld_983_3,"I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this."
meld_983_4,Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.
meld_983_5,"No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now."
meld_983_6,"Ugh! Joey, I have to go."
meld_983_7,Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!
meld_984_0,Oh hey Joey! What's up?
meld_984_1,"I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?"
meld_984_2,"Yeah, I've been around."
meld_984_3,"Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?"
meld_984_4,"Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees."
meld_984_5,Great! Problem solved!
meld_985_0,"Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance."
meld_985_1,"All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control."
meld_985_2,Why?
meld_985_3,"Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town."
meld_985_4,Bastard!
meld_986_0,You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!
meld_986_1,All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
meld_986_2,"Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it."
meld_986_3,"Oh, I can't believe it!"
meld_986_4,I mean I think it's great!
meld_986_5,For him.
meld_986_6,She might be able to do better.
meld_986_7,Hey guys!
meld_986_8,Joey! Come here! Come here!
meld_986_9,Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
meld_986_10,You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
meld_986_11,"No. Joey, she"
meld_986_12,"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?"
meld_986_13,"Yes, but y'know what?"
meld_986_14,It doesn't matter who knows what.
meld_986_15,"Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!"
meld_986_16,Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
meld_987_0,"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
meld_988_0,"Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things."
meld_988_1,You really think it would be that different?
meld_988_2,How could it not be?
meld_988_3,"I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids."
meld_988_4,And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a
meld_988_5,"Well, things change."
meld_988_6,I dont want them to move to a
meld_988_7,Itll be okay Joe.
meld_989_0,Its still there!
meld_989_1,Mrs. Braverman must be out.
meld_989_2,She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
meld_989_3,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake."
meld_989_4,No that could kill her.
meld_989_5,"Well, we dont want that."
meld_989_6,"No, so were protecting her."
meld_989_7,But we should take it.
meld_989_8,But we should move quick.
meld_989_9,Why?
meld_989_10,Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
meld_989_11,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
meld_990_0,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
meld_990_1,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
meld_990_2,"Well, you're gonna."
meld_990_3,"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
meld_990_4,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
meld_990_5,"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women."
meld_990_6,"And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?"
meld_990_7,"Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
meld_990_8,"Hey, you're not him."
meld_990_9,You're you.
meld_990_10,"When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
meld_990_11,No.
meld_990_12,No.
meld_990_13,You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
meld_990_14,"Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!"
meld_990_15,"And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
meld_990_16,You really think so?
meld_990_17,Yeah. I really do.
meld_990_18,"Thanks, Chandler."
meld_990_19,Get off!
meld_991_0,Hi.
meld_991_1,"Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?"
meld_991_2,"When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?"
meld_991_3,And the cream?
meld_991_4,Cheese makes me thirsty.
meld_991_5,Okay. Lets move on.
meld_991_6,All right.
meld_991_7,Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?
meld_991_8,Oh no!
meld_991_9,I dont know anything about cooking.
meld_991_10,"I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles."
meld_991_11,"Well, hats off to the chef."
meld_991_12,"I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?"
meld_991_13,The chef!
meld_991_14,Thats right.
meld_992_0,"Hey, Pheebs."
meld_992_1,Hey.
meld_992_2,How's it going?
meld_992_3,Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
meld_992_4,So what's going on?
meld_992_5,"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger."
meld_992_6,"I dunno, there's just something about..."
meld_992_7,Basically we just feel that he's...
meld_992_8,We hate that guy.
meld_992_9,Yeah. Hate him.
meld_992_10,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
meld_992_11,Uh-huh.
meld_992_12,Okay.
meld_992_13,"Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
meld_992_14,"...No, we hate him."
meld_992_15,We're sorry.
meld_993_0,Hey!
meld_993_1,Hey!
meld_993_2,What are you doing?
meld_993_3,Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
meld_994_0,Yes that was mine.
meld_994_1,Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
meld_994_2,Yes that would have made more sense.
meld_994_3,"Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!"
meld_994_4,"All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time."
meld_994_5,"And whatever you say, I'll believe ya."
meld_994_6,"Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?"
meld_995_0,"Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?"
meld_995_1,"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball."
meld_996_0,She said what?
meld_996_1,"She said, ""If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."""
meld_996_2,Postpone it?
meld_996_3,"Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?"
meld_996_4,"Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?"
meld_996_5,This isnt right.
meld_996_6,"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right."
meld_996_7,I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
meld_996_8,Dont you point your pants at me!
meld_996_9,We have no choice!
meld_996_10,"Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?"
meld_996_11,This is our wedding Im talking about.
meld_996_12,The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.
meld_996_13,So what are you saying? Its now or never?
meld_996_14,No. Im saying its now.
meld_996_15,Or?
meld_996_16,Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
meld_996_17,Its not the pants.
meld_996_18,Its you that is backwards.
meld_996_19,"And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!"
meld_996_20,"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please"
meld_997_0,"Hi, honey."
meld_997_1,See you later.
meld_997_2,"What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!"
meld_997_3,Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
meld_997_4,"Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller."
meld_997_5,Oh no!
meld_997_6,"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available"
meld_997_7,"Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!"
meld_997_8,This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
meld_997_9,NOOOO!!!!!!!!
meld_998_0,Ma! What're you doing here?
meld_998_1,I came to give you this  and this.
meld_998_2,Oww! Big ring!
meld_999_0,"Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice."
meld_999_1,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
meld_999_2,"Yeah, yeah, all the time."
meld_999_3,Really?
meld_999_4,"But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy."
meld_1000_0,Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
meld_1000_1,Have you ever seen so much crap?
meld_1000_2,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap"
meld_1000_3,Check this out. Can I have this?
meld_1001_0,What?
meld_1001_1,"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti."
meld_1001_2,"All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office."
meld_1001_3,"It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job."
meld_1001_4,"If it's not you, this is a horrible story."
meld_1001_5,"Fortunately, it is me."
meld_1001_6,"And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much."
meld_1001_7,"Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate."
meld_1001_8,"Y'know, someplace nice."
meld_1001_9,"Yeah, someplace nice."
meld_1001_10,Yeah!
meld_1001_11,How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
meld_1002_0,"So, what do you think?"
meld_1002_1,I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
meld_1002_2,I know!
meld_1002_3,"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?"
meld_1002_4,"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"
meld_1002_5,Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
meld_1003_0,Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
meld_1003_1,Gotcha.
meld_1003_2,This place is really my Grandmothers.
meld_1003_3,"I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this."
meld_1003_4,"So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR."
meld_1003_5,So are you thirsty?
meld_1003_6,"Oh, you bet I am!"
meld_1003_7,"Okay, heres your penis!"
meld_1004_0,"Ohh, okay."
meld_1004_1,"Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house."
meld_1004_2,"Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen."
meld_1005_0,"Hey, ready for dinner?"
meld_1005_1,"Ooh, absolutely!"
meld_1005_2,Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
meld_1005_3,"Ooh, I love that place!  So, no."
meld_1005_4,How about Mama Lisettie's?
meld_1005_5,Enh. Sure!
meld_1005_6,I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.
meld_1005_7,"Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!"
meld_1005_8,Thatthis milk is mine.
meld_1005_9,"I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know."
meld_1005_10,"Okay, let's go!"
meld_1005_11,"Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the"
meld_1005_12,But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
meld_1005_13,"Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!"
meld_1005_14,"Okay, stop!"
meld_1005_15,"Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?"
meld_1005_16,"Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?"
meld_1005_17,"Well, I suppose I could give him a warning."
meld_1005_18,Thank you.
meld_1005_19,Go!
meld_1005_20,Go!
meld_1005_21,"Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose."
meld_1006_0,"No! No! Phoebe, come on! I dont want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!"
meld_1006_1,No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink!
meld_1006_2,I know. Im sorry.
meld_1006_3,All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
meld_1006_4,Yeah.
meld_1006_5,"God, what a mess."
meld_1007_0,"Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross."
meld_1007_1,"Well, I lost."
meld_1007_2,"Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S."
meld_1007_3,"Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes."
meld_1007_4,Hey! Howd the interview go?
meld_1007_5,"Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me."
meld_1007_6,"Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job."
meld_1007_7,Thats not how that was supposed to come out.
meld_1007_8,This is the worst Christmas ever.
meld_1007_9,"Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house."
meld_1007_10,I cant!
meld_1007_11,Its too late!
meld_1007_12,Terry already hired that girl over there.
meld_1007_13,"Look at her, shes even got waitress experience."
meld_1007_14,Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
meld_1007_15,That word was swans.
meld_1008_0,What do we got there?
meld_1008_1,"A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!"
meld_1008_2,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
meld_1008_3,It's all right.
meld_1008_4,It's all right.
meld_1008_5,You don't have to explain.
meld_1008_6,This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
meld_1008_7,You're our third call tonight.
meld_1008_8,Really?
meld_1008_9,"Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year."
meld_1009_0,"I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down."
meld_1009_1,"No, you were right. I don't have a plan."
meld_1009_2,Thank God. Food.
meld_1009_3,Phoebe?
meld_1009_4,What?
meld_1009_5,Do you have a plan?
meld_1009_6,I don't even have a 'pl'.
meld_1009_7,"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese."
meld_1009_8,Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
meld_1009_9,"Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?"
meld_1009_10,Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
meld_1009_11,And-and a power tie?
meld_1009_12,Oh God.
meld_1009_13,Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
meld_1009_14,"Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?"
meld_1009_15,Big Bird's friend.
meld_1009_16,I see pizza!
meld_1009_17,"Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!"
meld_1009_18,Hello? Who are we spying on?
meld_1010_0,"Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?"
meld_1010_1,What?!
meld_1010_2,"I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker."
meld_1010_3,"No, no!"
meld_1010_4,What are you crazy?!
meld_1010_5,"Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, its like a law!"
meld_1010_6,Allll done!
meld_1010_7,"Aww, thank you."
meld_1010_8,"Okay, whos next?!"

meld_1016_8,"Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?"
meld_1016_9,I ate a bug.
meld_1016_10,"Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Lets stock up."
meld_1016_11,"Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck."
meld_1016_12,"Oh, now you want a favour?"
meld_1016_13,"Yes, please."
meld_1016_14,"Well, oh, Im sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but Im a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?"
meld_1016_15,"Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends."
meld_1016_16,"No, Im not gonna pick them up."
meld_1016_17,"Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk."
meld_1016_18,"So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car."
meld_1016_19,"No, Rachel doesnt want me to...."
meld_1016_20,"Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what Rachel did to you."
meld_1016_21,"Yeah, youre right."
meld_1017_0,"God, I feel so guilty about Ross."
meld_1017_1,"Oh, I know."
meld_1017_2,I kinda feel like it's my fault.
meld_1017_3,Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
meld_1017_4,"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!"
meld_1017_5,"Well, I think it's very brave what you said."
meld_1017_6,"All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places."
meld_1017_7,"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?"
meld_1017_8,"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice."
meld_1017_9,"Okay, I admit it!"
meld_1017_10,I love this coat!
meld_1017_11,"Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!"
meld_1017_12,Remember Phil Huntley?
meld_1017_13,He was fine!
meld_1018_0,So your dad dropped by. Hes a pleasant man!
meld_1018_1,Oh no

meld_1018_3,"Ross Im so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail."
meld_1018_4,I dont care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now shes totally freaked out!
meld_1018_5,"Oh okay, Ill fix that to. Whats her e-mail address?"
meld_1018_6,Rachel!
meld_1018_7,"All right, I promise. Ill fix this. I swear. Ill-Ill-Ill-Ill talk to her."
meld_1018_8,Okay!
meld_1018_9,Okay.
meld_1018_10,Thank you!
meld_1018_11,Thats it?!
meld_1018_12,You call that a fight?
meld_1018_13,Come on!
meld_1018_14,"""We were on a break!"""
meld_1018_15,"""No we werent!"""
meld_1018_16,What happened to you two?
meld_1019_0,"Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?"
meld_1019_1,I'm sorry.
meld_1019_2,"But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it."
meld_1019_3,"Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing."
meld_1019_4,"Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes."
meld_1019_5,Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the
meld_1019_6,"I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir."
meld_1019_7,Is this because of the burrito thing?
meld_1019_8,You need to give him money.
meld_1019_9,Give him money? It was a joke!
meld_1019_10,"No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off."
meld_1019_11,"Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money."
meld_1019_12,You've got to be smooth about it.
meld_1019_13,"Hey, I can be smooth."
meld_1019_14,"Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it."
meld_1019_15,"Of course, sir."
meld_1019_16,Okay.
meld_1020_0,Id better get back to my desk.
meld_1020_1,"Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your evaluation."
meld_1020_2,My what?
meld_1020_3,"Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation."
meld_1020_4,"But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate."
meld_1020_5,Are you serious?
meld_1020_6,"No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?"
meld_1021_0,I can blow dry it.
meld_1021_1,I can put gel on it.
meld_1021_2,"It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head."
meld_1021_3,Its so annoying.
meld_1021_4,Does it bug you?
meld_1021_5,You bug me.
meld_1021_6,Is there any chance you didnt see that?
meld_1022_0,"Hey Joey, what cha doing?"
meld_1022_1,Sweepin. Why? Turn you on?
meld_1022_2,No.
meld_1022_3,Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
meld_1022_4,"Joey, did"
meld_1022_5,Where are you going? The vicar wont be home for hours.
meld_1022_6,"Joey,  where did you learn that word?"
meld_1022_7,"Where do you think,  Zelda?"
meld_1022_8,You found my book?!
meld_1022_9,Yeah I did!
meld_1022_10,"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!"
meld_1022_11,"Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnt have, but you got porn!"
meld_1022_12,"Hey-hey, yknow what?"
meld_1022_15,Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica.
meld_1022_16,"Its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand."
meld_1022_17,You got porn!
meld_1023_0,"Well, I feel like a snack!"
meld_1023_1,Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.
meld_1023_2,Oh no thanks. I dont like
meld_1023_3,What?!
meld_1023_4,"Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories."
meld_1023_5,"Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots."
meld_1023_6,You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
meld_1023_7,How did you know about that?!
meld_1024_0,Hi!
meld_1024_1,Hi!
meld_1024_2,Come in.
meld_1024_3,"Thanks for comin back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and"
meld_1024_4,Great!
meld_1024_5,"Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match."
meld_1024_6,"Okay, so I made up a little test."
meld_1024_7,"Now, Im gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind."
meld_1024_8,I can do that.

meld_1025_1,"Alright, and if youre gonna put your feet up, why dont you sit on the-"
meld_1025_2,"Monica, leave him alone"
meld_1025_3,Will you hurry up?
meld_1025_4,Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janines friends are dancers?!
meld_1025_5,And that theyre going to be drinking alot!
meld_1025_6,"No, I did, but tell me again, because its so romantic."
meld_1025_7,Well youre whippin so slow! Cant you do it any faster?
meld_1025_8,Joey!
meld_1025_9,Come on!
meld_1025_10,"I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright?"
meld_1025_11,"This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
meld_1025_12,"So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?"
meld_1025_13,Oh I am!
meld_1025_14,"Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will!"
meld_1025_15,"Okay, fine!"
meld_1025_16,Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
meld_1025_17,"Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it cant? Okay."
meld_1026_0,You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
meld_1026_1,"Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny."
meld_1026_2,"Okay, now you're even cuter!!"
meld_1026_3,Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
meld_1026_4,What?
meld_1026_5,"The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me."
meld_1026_6,What are you talking about?
meld_1026_7,I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
meld_1026_8,That's not possible!
meld_1026_9,Ow!
meld_1026_10,"I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way."
meld_1026_11,"Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough."
meld_1026_12,"I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her."
meld_1026_13,"No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!"
meld_1026_14,This bicep?
meld_1026_15,Well it's not flexed right now!
meld_1027_0,It's Phoebe.
meld_1027_1,"Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?"
meld_1027_2,"Umm, well, umm Grandma died."
meld_1027_3,"No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow."
meld_1027_4,No you didn't!
meld_1027_5,"Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?"
meld_1027_6,"Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert."
meld_1028_0,"anyway, his name is Allan and weve been going out for three years."

meld_1028_2,He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.
meld_1028_3,Oh well.
meld_1028_4,And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
meld_1028_5,"Oh. Oh, thats great!"
meld_1029_0,Really? Like how?
meld_1029_1,"Well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so theyd put salt on their cereal."
meld_1029_2,Thats a good one.
meld_1029_3,Yeah? You like that one?
meld_1029_4,"Yeah, youre funny."
meld_1029_5,Im funny?
meld_1029_6,Oh thank God!
meld_1029_7,"Well hey, Ive got a ton of these!"
meld_1029_8,"Umm, oh hereDo you want a good one?"
meld_1029_9,"Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge."
meld_1029_10,Right?
meld_1029_11,"And then you say to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face."
meld_1029_12,"And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face."
meld_1029_13,Can I do it to you?
meld_1029_14,"Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay?"
meld_1030_0,Chloe? Hi..
meld_1030_1,Is this about me taking your watch?
meld_1030_2,You took my watch?
meld_1030_3,"Im sorry, I do that."
meld_1030_4,"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?"
meld_1030_5,"Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know."
meld_1031_0,"Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration."
meld_1031_1,Yeah. That-that was the problem.
meld_1031_2,"Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!"
meld_1031_3,Bing! You got those numbers for me?
meld_1032_0,So you still in touch with anyone from high school?

meld_1032_4,"Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time."
meld_1032_5,"Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire, J.T., Beardsley."
meld_1032_6,Is that all?
meld_1032_7,"Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman."
meld_1032_8,"Ohh, how is he?"
meld_1032_9,"Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie."
meld_1032_10,Isnt he an architect now?
meld_1032_11,"Yeah, they still wear underwear."
meld_1033_0,So the Porsche guy took his car back.
meld_1033_1,But you found the keys to his clothes?
meld_1033_2,"No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche."
meld_1033_3,And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the clothes?
meld_1034_0,"Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!"
meld_1034_1,Hey!
meld_1034_2,Oh! Its you.  Hi.
meld_1035_0,What about me?! You-you just said I could!

meld_1036_4,You're kidding right?
meld_1036_5,No.
meld_1036_6,What?!
meld_1036_7,"It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out."
meld_1036_8,"Uh, hang out?! How long?"
meld_1036_9,I don't know.
meld_1036_10,A week?
meld_1036_11,Maybe two?
meld_1036_12,The money will turn up!
meld_1036_13,People will always wanna invest in movies!

meld_1038_3,I broke up with her.
meld_1038_4,"Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing?"
meld_1038_5,"They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them."
meld_1038_6,"Come on, they were not that huge."
meld_1038_7,"I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain."
meld_1038_8,How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
meld_1038_9,"Hold it, hold it."
meld_1038_10,I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
meld_1038_11,"When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple."
meld_1038_12,It made me nuts.
meld_1038_13,You or me?
meld_1038_14,"I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples."
meld_1038_15,"You guys are messing with me, right?"
meld_1038_16,Yeah.
meld_1038_17,"That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa."""
