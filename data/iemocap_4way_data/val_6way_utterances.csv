meld_4_5,Uhh.
meld_4_6,"Ah AhGet out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marions views on evolution?"
meld_4_7,"Uh, actually I find Marions views far too progressionist."
meld_4_8,I find Marions views far too progressionist.
meld_4_9,"Im sorry, who are you?"
meld_4_10,"Im a professor here uh, RossGeller."
meld_4_11,"Ross Geller, why do I know that name? Its uhWait!  Did you write this?"
meld_4_12,Yes! Youre the person who checked out my book?!
meld_4_13,"Yknow, you look nothing like I wouldve thought. Youreyoure so young."
meld_4_14,"Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
meld_5_0,You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
meld_5_1,What?
meld_5_2,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
meld_5_3,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
meld_5_4,The point is I...
meld_5_5,"I don't need this right now, OK."
meld_5_6,"It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy."
meld_5_7,This ship has sailed.
meld_5_8,"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
meld_5_9,Fine.
meld_5_10,Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
meld_5_11,Good.
meld_5_12,Good.
meld_6_0,"Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon."
meld_6_1,"Yknow, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something."
meld_6_2,All in good time my love.
meld_6_3,All in good time.
meld_6_4,Oh shoot!
meld_6_5,I left my guitar in their apartment.
meld_6_6,Well you can let me in later.
meld_6_7,"I dont have a key, they took mine to give to you."
meld_6_8,What?! They took mine to give to you!
meld_6_9,Why would they take away our keys?
meld_7_0,Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
meld_7_1,"Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all."
meld_7_2,A
meld_7_3,No. Shes going to live with us for eight weeks.
meld_7_4,"Uh, what?"
meld_7_5,Yes! Shes gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
meld_7_6,WhatYoure not serious.
meld_7_7,"I mean shes a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her."
meld_7_8,Shell drive us totally crazy.
meld_7_9,Hi Ross!
meld_7_10,Hi roomie!
meld_8_0,Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
meld_8_1,I dont know!
meld_8_2,Its not like its porn!
meld_8_3,"This is a serious, legitimate movie."
meld_8_4,And the nudity is really important to the story.
meld_8_5,Thats what you say about porn.
meld_8_6,Youre right. Maybe I shouldnt even go on the call back.
meld_8_7,"No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!"
meld_8_8,Well thats true.
meld_8_9,And I am only naked in one scene.
meld_8_10,Plus it sounds really great.
meld_8_11,My characters catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.
meld_8_12,Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.
meld_8_13,So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other.
meld_8_14,Its really sweet and-and tender.
meld_9_0,"Hey, whats up?"
meld_9_1,"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight."
meld_9_2,"But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today."
meld_9_3,"""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!"
meld_9_4,Yeah?
meld_9_5,"I just figured yknow, after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow?"
meld_9_6,"Someone I can learn from, someone-someone whos different than me."
meld_9_7,And whats more different than me. A guy whos
meld_10_0,So where are we going next?
meld_10_1,This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
meld_10_2,"Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
meld_10_3,"Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?"
meld_10_4,It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
meld_10_5,"Yeah, no one talks like that!"
meld_10_6,Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
meld_10_7,"Hey, I'm more cop than you two!"
meld_10_8,How do you figure that?
meld_10_9,"Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!"
meld_11_0,I guess so.
meld_11_1,Here you go. Thank you!
meld_11_2,"Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?"
meld_11_3,"Oh what, you-you want both of them?"
meld_11_4,"Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!"
meld_11_5,"Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it."
meld_11_6,"I know it's in the apartment, but I"
meld_11_7,"Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!"
meld_11_8,Tell her to wear her own earrings.
meld_11_9,These
meld_11_10,Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
meld_11_11,Why not?
meld_11_12,Because I lose her stuff!
meld_12_0,"Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?"
meld_12_1,Yeah!
meld_12_2,Whats going on?
meld_12_3,Chandlers gone again!
meld_12_4,Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
meld_13_0,Okay. You ready to push again?
meld_13_1,I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
meld_13_2,"Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!"
meld_13_3,Yeah!!
meld_13_4,Little Leslie is here!
meld_13_5,We got another one!
meld_13_6,"Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children."
meld_13_7,How scary is that?
meld_13_8,"Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!"
meld_13_9,"All right, he's coming. He's coming!"
meld_13_10,"Hey, where's his thing?"
meld_13_11,Chandler's a girl!
meld_13_12,"Oh God, kindergarten flashback."
meld_13_13,They musta read the sonogram wrong.
meld_13_14,"Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl!"
meld_13_15,Chandler's a girl!
meld_13_16,"Okay, keep saying it!"
meld_13_17,Am I too late?!
meld_13_18,"No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes."
meld_13_19,We have our babies?
meld_13_20,Yeah.
meld_13_21,"Oh, we have our babies."
meld_14_0,Hey Toby!
meld_14_1,Hey Bobby.
meld_14_2,"Its Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler"
meld_14_3,"Uhh yeah. Yeah, its  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?"
meld_14_4,"I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is."
meld_14_5,"Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job up here."
meld_14_6,Toby dont.
meld_14_7,Bob!
meld_14_8,Toby! Im not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
meld_15_0,Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! Its so cute!
meld_15_1,I know! I found it on the street.
meld_15_2,Are you seriousReally?! Its in such good condition.
meld_15_3,Yeah.
meld_15_4,Wow! Whoa-whoa whats under the covers?
meld_15_5,I dont know.
meld_15_6,Its moving.
meld_15_7,Ew.
meld_15_8,Its stillIts got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
meld_15_9,Ooh! Ah! Okay!
meld_16_0,"Well, I went over to Kyles last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing"
meld_16_1,we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So
meld_16_2,Oh just say it Kyle!
meld_16_3,Were gonna give it another try.
meld_16_4,What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
meld_16_5,Im gonna work on that.
meld_16_6,"Oh right, because youre so capable of change."
meld_16_7,"Yknow, he hums when he pees!"
meld_16_8,I do know.
meld_16_9,"It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever."
meld_16_10,Were so sorry.
meld_16_11,"Thats all right, we-we dont need you. In fact, hey Im over it already."
meld_16_12,"Yeah, and yknow what? I dont give a tiny rats ass."
meld_16_13,"Yeah, were gonna go."
meld_16_14,"Im sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Yknow, she"
meld_16_15,"Oh. Yknow, he hums while he does other stuff to."
meld_16_16,"Yeah, we're better off without them."
meld_16_17,"And yknow, even if they break up again, youd better not let him in your sad mens club!"
meld_16_18,Divorced mens club.
meld_17_0,Why isnt that valet back with my Porsche?
meld_17_1,Maybe because youve got the keys?
meld_17_2,This is totally your fault!
meld_17_3,My fault?! You threatened the judge!
meld_17_4,"Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!!"
meld_18_0,Phoebe!
meld_18_1,Yeah?
meld_18_2,Have you seen Chandler?!
meld_18_3,No! Why?
meld_18_4,The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!
meld_18_5,I know!
meld_18_6,How bad is this?
meld_18_7,"Well for the regular guy, its bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!"
meld_18_8,I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I cant find him anywhere!
meld_18_9,What are you gonna do?
meld_18_10,"Well, Im never gonna listen to you again, thats for sure!"
meld_18_11,"""Yknow, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"""
meld_18_12,Rachel said that!
meld_18_13,Well Rachels not here!
meld_19_0,"Come on, come on."
meld_19_1,"Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit."
meld_19_2,This is all your fault.
meld_19_3,"This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?"
meld_19_4,"My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
meld_19_5,The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
meld_19_6,"No no no, believe me."
meld_19_7,"No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?"
meld_19_8,And you know what the funny thing is?
meld_19_9,"When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?"
meld_19_10,Where does that leave me?
meld_19_11,You get to be the baby's father.
meld_19_12,Everyone knows who you are.
meld_19_13,Who am I?
meld_19_14,"There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day."
meld_19_15,Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
meld_19_16,This is so great.
meld_19_17,You wanna explain that?
meld_19_18,"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one."
meld_19_19,And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.
meld_19_20,And it's not even born yet.
meld_19_21,"It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world."
meld_19_22,"I'm sorry, you were fighting."
meld_20_0,"Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out."
meld_20_1,"Hi, how are you doing Kelly?"
meld_20_2,"I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!"
meld_20_3,It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can
meld_20_4,"Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!"
meld_20_5,This is disgusting!
meld_20_6,I'm not reading this!
meld_20_7,What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
meld_21_0,"All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser."
meld_21_1,"I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
meld_21_2,You know he's gay?
meld_21_3,I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
meld_21_4,"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
meld_21_5,Hi. Hi.
meld_21_6,What are you doing here?
meld_22_0,"Well, what?"
meld_22_1,What?
meld_22_2,What is it?
meld_22_3,That she left you?
meld_22_4,That she likes women?
meld_22_5,That she left you for another woman that likes women?
meld_22_6,"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
meld_22_7,Then what?
meld_22_8,My first time with Carol was...
meld_22_9,What?
meld_22_10,It was my
meld_22_11,With Carol?  Oh.
meld_22_12,"So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh."
meld_22_13,"Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!"
meld_23_0,Hi. Where is everybody?
meld_23_1,"Oh, its already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?"
meld_23_2,"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
meld_23_3,Oh no! Why?
meld_23_4,"Cause Carols a lesbian.  And, and Im not one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation."
meld_23_5,"Oh my God! I dont believe it! Oh, you poor bunny."
meld_23_6,Im an idiot.
meld_23_7,"I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and Id be out and shed, shed see some beautiful woman, and, and shed be Ross y'know look at her, and Id think, God, my wife is cool!"
meld_23_8,"Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?"
meld_23_9,"Well, now I do!!"
meld_23_10,Im sorry.
meld_23_11,Seven years.
meld_23_12,"I mean weve been together seven years, shes the only woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever...."
meld_23_13,"Aw, God Ross. Oh."
meld_24_0,Ill do it.
meld_24_1,No you wont.
meld_24_2,"Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, hes sorry."
meld_24_3,"But,  youve got one more apology to make, all right, youve got to apologize to Mary-Angela."
meld_24_4,"Okay, absolutely!"
meld_24_5,All right.
meld_24_6,Youve got it.
meld_24_7,"Cookie, now you can punch him!"
meld_24_8,What?!
meld_25_0,"All right, that's it, I quit."
meld_25_1,What? I didn't say anything.
meld_25_2,"Yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person."
meld_25_3,"Ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
meld_25_4,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
meld_25_5,Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
meld_26_0,Julie.
meld_26_1,What?!
meld_26_2,Jody!
meld_26_3,You were with Julie?
meld_26_4,"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend."
meld_26_5,"And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping."
meld_26_6,Oh. Oh my God.
meld_26_7,"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
meld_26_8,"Yeah, right.  Sure!"
meld_26_9,"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time."
meld_26_10,"Look, I'm sorry, all right."
meld_26_11,I never meant for you to find out!
meld_26_12,"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught."
meld_26_13,That is not true!
meld_26_14,"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
meld_26_15,Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
meld_26_16,"Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to"
meld_27_0,Yeah!
meld_27_1,I cant say.
meld_27_2,Why?!
meld_27_3,Why not?
meld_27_4,I cant say because hes famous.
meld_27_5,"Oh my God, who is it?!"
meld_27_6,"Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us."
meld_27_7,"Okay, okay. Its James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby."
meld_27_8,As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin?
meld_27_9,What?! Well he never said that to me!
meld_28_0,In
meld_28_1,"Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse."
meld_28_2,"Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories."
meld_28_3,Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
meld_28_4,I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
meld_28_5,"Oh, let's not tell this story."
meld_28_6,"Oh, come on!"
meld_28_7,"Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!"
meld_28_8,What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
meld_28_9,"Hey, it's not like it sounds."
meld_28_10,It's
meld_29_0,"Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!"
meld_29_1,Who was that?
meld_29_2,Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
meld_29_3,Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
meld_29_4,Ten dollars an hour.
meld_29_5,No.
meld_29_6,Twelve dollars an hour.
meld_29_7,"Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
meld_29_8,"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you."
meld_29_9,"I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour."
meld_29_10,Done.
meld_30_0,"The reactors gonna blow in three seconds, were never gonna make it!"
meld_30_1,Youve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
meld_30_2,No! I wont leave you!
meld_30_3,"Dont worry about me, Im a robot! Im just a machine!!"
meld_30_4,No youre not! Not to me!
meld_30_5,Oh my God.
meld_30_6,What?
meld_30_7,I am
meld_30_8,"Yeah, youre great! Okay, lets take it from"
meld_30_9,"No, I mean I was really acting my ass off."
meld_30_10,"Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too."
meld_30_11,"Oh yeah, youre solid. Yeah, youre just no me."
meld_30_12,Yknow what? I think thats enough for now. Yeah. I dont want to be over rehearsed.
meld_30_13,Fine!
meld_30_14,Ill do it without you!
meld_30_15,I dont need you or anybody else!
meld_30_16,Im gonna make it on my own!
meld_30_17,Youll see!!
meld_30_18,Youll
meld_31_0,I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
meld_31_1,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
meld_31_2,We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
meld_31_3,I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
meld_31_4,"And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
meld_31_5,I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance.
meld_31_6,But you didn't!
meld_31_7,I'm still alive!!
meld_31_8,"Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you."
meld_31_9,It's a long story but the things    you just said really made my day!
meld_31_10,"I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people!"
meld_31_11,"You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on    you!"
meld_31_12,Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
meld_32_0,Well do a quick check.
meld_32_1,Okay.
meld_32_2,"So, eight days late huh?"
meld_32_3,Yeah.
meld_32_4,You must be a little uncomfortable.
meld_32_5,"Eh, just a tad."
meld_32_6,"Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way."
meld_32_7,It still could last a little while longer.
meld_32_8,If youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
meld_32_9,Do them!!
meld_32_10,"Actually, theyre things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience Ive found that some of them are quite effective."
meld_32_11,"Well, we are ready to try anything."
meld_32_12,"Okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink."
meld_32_13,Okay.
meld_33_0,What is wrong with Emma?
meld_33_1,"Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa."
meld_34_0,Anytime you're ready.
meld_34_1,"Ok, ok, here we go."
meld_34_2,"Ok, where am I talking to, here?"
meld_34_3,"I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..."
meld_34_4,Just aim for the bump.
meld_34_5,"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes."
meld_34_6,"You know, I, you know, can't do this."
meld_34_7,"Uh, this is too weird."
meld_34_8,I feel stupid.
meld_34_9,"So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it."
meld_34_10,"Hello, baby. Hello, hello."
meld_35_0,"Oh, hi. Its Mark."
meld_36_0,Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
meld_36_1,"Okay, I do."
meld_36_2,Okay.
meld_36_3,I really do.
meld_36_4,"Okay, Im gonna get your coat and then Ill-Ill put you in a cab."
meld_36_5,"Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, youre not gonna come with me?"
meld_36_6,Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
meld_36_7,Okay.
meld_36_8,Okay?
meld_36_9,Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!
meld_36_10,"What?! I wh-, whats wrong?"
meld_36_11,"Im sorry, I just cant go to the hospital lookin like this."
meld_37_0,"Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, hes just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just..."
meld_37_1,"Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!"
meld_37_2,"Oh, I cant watch this."
meld_37_3,"Check it out, hes winning!  Petes winning!"
meld_37_4,Really?!
meld_37_5,No-o-o!!
meld_37_6,"Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area."
meld_37_7,Oh! Oh!
meld_37_8,"Wait, if thats his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?"
meld_37_9,"Well, this is ironic."
meld_37_10,"Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didnt want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete cant."
meld_38_0,"Dude, you dont have to brag! We got nothing here!!"
meld_39_0,Should we tell Rachel theres an empty private room right next door to hers?
meld_39_1,"We could, or we can have sex in it."
meld_39_2,"Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!"
meld_40_0,I thought I was a complete idiot.
meld_40_1,"Hey, Im with you. He even asked me if I thought youd go out with him."
meld_40_2,"Oh! Oh, I think Im gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?"
meld_40_3,I said no.
meld_40_4,What?!
meld_40_5,What? II just figured since youre pregnant youre not gonna be seeing people.
meld_40_6,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?"
meld_40_7,I didnt tell him. I didnt know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
meld_40_8,"Good-good, dont tell him. Dont tell him. Just have him call me okay?"
meld_40_9,"Rach look, I really dont think thats such a great"
meld_40_10,"Okay, you go do it! Ill come back to that set! Ill meet more actors! Ill meet em all!"
meld_41_0,"Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshuas gone so you and Emily are free to go."
meld_41_1,Thats okay.
meld_41_2,"Shes still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, its too late to do any of the things I had planned, so"
meld_42_0,Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
meld_42_1,You tell them to wait!
meld_42_2,Okay. Wait! Wait!
meld_42_3,Emily.
meld_42_4,Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily!
meld_43_0,Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
meld_43_1,Okay.
meld_44_0,I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
meld_44_1,Nevermind!
meld_44_2,"No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in."
meld_44_3,Jen.
meld_44_4,"Jen, I know this may sound a little But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or"
meld_44_5,Sure! That would be nice.
meld_44_6,Umm?
meld_44_7,Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call.
meld_44_8,I will give you a call.
meld_44_9,I'll see you later.
meld_44_10,Okay!
meld_44_11,I forgot my paper.
meld_45_0,"Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves."
meld_45_1,What?
meld_45_2,Okay.
meld_45_3,Ow!
meld_45_4,Arent you gonna go?
meld_45_5,No. Thank you.
meld_45_6,"No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms."
meld_45_7,"Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is no tissue, no tuschy.  Well, if everybodys going."
meld_45_8,"No, y'know what dont close it  cause the... keys...are in there."
meld_45_9,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"
meld_45_10,Whats going on?
meld_45_11,My lighters in there!
meld_46_0,I promise.
meld_46_1,"Although, dont feel like you cant visit."
meld_46_2,"Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?"
meld_46_3,"No, no hes not."
meld_46_4,"You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband."
meld_46_5,"What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?"
meld_46_6,"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not."
meld_46_7,"Joey, you cant keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him."
meld_46_8,"Itll kill him. I mean itll, itll just kill him."
meld_46_9,"Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe"
meld_47_0,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
meld_47_1,"Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of"
meld_47_2,"Ah yeah, but now its Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home."
meld_47_3,Wheres Ben?
meld_47_4,Hes sleeping.
meld_47_5,"Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
meld_47_6,"Umm, yeah, actually, Susans gonna be home any minute, its kinda an anniversary."
meld_47_7,"Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?"
meld_47_8,Its not that kind of anniversary.
meld_47_9,Ah!  Oh.
meld_47_10,Sooo!! Anyway...
meld_48_0,Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
meld_48_1,"Oh, oh, oh, Ill get Rainy Day Bear!!"
meld_48_2,"Because hell know what to do?  Oh my God, youre a genius!"
meld_48_3,"Oh God, oh God, its sowed on though."
meld_48_4,Give it. Give it.
meld_48_5,Okay.
meld_48_6,Oh!!
meld_48_7,"Oh, its just like a bloodbath in here today."
meld_49_0,Please. This is so your fault.
meld_49_1,"How, how is this my fault?"
meld_49_2,"Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
meld_49_3,"Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along."
meld_49_6,"Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!"
meld_49_7,Get in here.
meld_49_8,Come on.
meld_49_9,"My god, you guys, I don't believe you."
meld_49_10,There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.
meld_49_11,"So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!"
meld_49_12,"Yeah, Susan."
meld_49_13,"Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
meld_49_14,"Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?"
meld_50_0,"Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, ""Son of a bitch?"""
meld_50_1,I didnt do that! Who wouldve done that?!
meld_50_2,Son of a bitch!
meld_50_3,"Okay, maybe ask this guy."
meld_51_0,"Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project."
meld_51_1,"Yknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arent they?"
meld_51_2,"Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Yknow? The only problem is, Carls acting is"
meld_51_3,The
meld_51_4,"Yeah, hes the reason I didnt get that big"
meld_51_5,"Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?"
meld_51_6,Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
meld_52_0,"Hey Monica, theres a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?"
meld_52_1,"Sure, I love this part!"
meld_52_2,Come on in.
meld_53_0,"Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment."
meld_53_1,"In the moment, yeah."
meld_53_2,But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
meld_53_3,"Sure, New Years Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?"
meld_53_4,No.
meld_53_5,Me neither.
meld_53_6,"3, 2,"
meld_53_7,"Joey, you dont have to count down every time we kiss."
meld_53_8,"Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready."
meld_54_0,Alright. Phoebe?
meld_54_1,"Okay, okay."
meld_54_2,"If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!"
meld_54_3,"Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?"
meld_54_4,"Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever."
meld_54_5,"See, there's always one guy.  ""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."""
meld_54_6,"Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy."
meld_54_7,"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?"
meld_54_8,Probably kill myself!
meld_54_9,..Excuse me?
meld_54_10,"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!"
meld_54_11,"Joey, uh-"
meld_54_12,You
meld_55_0,Im sorry.
meld_56_0,"Joey, onstage!"
meld_56_1,Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?
meld_56_2,"I mean, Ill go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye."
meld_56_3,Where are you Vic?
meld_56_4,Flights in an hour. I-I gotta go.
meld_56_5,Vic! Vic!
meld_56_6,In a minute!!
meld_56_7,So this is it? Victor?
meld_56_8,"Yeah, I guess it is."
meld_56_9,"Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me."
meld_56_10,"One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you."
meld_56_11,"But, youve got things you have to do now, and so do I."
meld_56_12,"And so Im gonna get on this spaceship,  and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels."
meld_56_13,"But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone."
meld_56_14,But I wont have aged at all.
meld_56_15,"So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, Im gonna want to meet her."
meld_56_16,"So long, Vic!"
meld_57_0,Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is
meld_57_1,"See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on"
meld_57_2,"What song was that, Pheebs?"
meld_57_3,Hi Monica!
meld_57_4,Hey Mon!
meld_57_5,Hey Mon!
meld_57_6,"Oh my God, has she slept at all?"
meld_57_7,Nope.
meld_57_8,"No, it's been three nights in a row."
meld_57_9,"Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so."
meld_57_10,"Oh, okay that explains it."
meld_57_11,"I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum."
meld_57_12,But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
meld_58_0,"So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
meld_58_1,"Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."
meld_58_2,"Yeah, I know but"
meld_58_3,"Oh no-no-no, Im there."
meld_58_4,Hey!
meld_58_5,Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
meld_58_6,You made pancakes?
meld_58_7,Yep! Grab a plate.
meld_58_8,"No-no, stay right there.  Gettin closer."
meld_58_9,"Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,"
meld_58_10,"Listen also were uh, were watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over."
meld_58_11,Oh yeah!
meld_59_0,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches."
meld_59_1,"Yeah, hero sandwiches."
meld_59_2,Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.
meld_59_3,"When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all."
meld_59_4,Not you Joey.
meld_60_0,Oh my good God.
meld_60_1,"Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs."
meld_60_2,"Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now."
meld_60_3,"I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me."
meld_60_4,"Oh, the mixed tape."
meld_60_5,The Way You Look Tonight
meld_60_6,You are just the sweetest.
meld_61_0,Hey!
meld_61_1,Hey!
meld_61_2,"Hey, guess what Im doing tonight."
meld_61_3,What?
meld_61_4,Im checking out the restaurant with Pete.
meld_61_5,"Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you."
meld_62_0,"So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find"
meld_62_1,"Ooh, actually Ive been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!"
meld_62_2,"Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someones been doing their homework."
meld_62_3,"Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so"
meld_62_4,"Oh, I know.  Yknow, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda"
meld_62_5,"Oh, me too."
meld_63_0,"and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!"
meld_63_1,"Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible."
meld_63_2,But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem?
meld_63_3,It was really fun being married to you tonight.
meld_63_4,"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made."
meld_63_5,"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?"
meld_63_6,Yeah.
meld_63_7,"That proposal, at the planetarium"
meld_63_8,"I know, I know it was stupid."
meld_63_9,Are you kidding?!
meld_63_10,"With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!"
meld_63_11,It wasreally wonderful!
meld_63_12,Did you just make that up?
meld_63_13,"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out."
meld_63_14,"Its how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me."
meld_63_15,"Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too."
meld_63_16,"Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night"
meld_63_17,Goodnight
meld_63_18,Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up?
meld_63_19,I will think about it.
meld_63_20,Thats all Im askin
meld_64_0,"You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldnt feel bad!"
meld_64_1,"Well actually, I-I didnt eat mine. Its still in the bathroom."
meld_64_2,"No it isnt, I ate that."
meld_64_3,Well we left ours in Monicas bedroom.
meld_64_4,"Nope, got it and I got yours  too."
meld_65_0,And thats Im so glad theres no problem.
meld_65_1,"Thats fine, actually Im on the hiring committee, so therell be at least one friendly face."
meld_65_2,Ohh! Thats great!
meld_65_3,"You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the"
meld_65_4,Really?!
meld_65_5,No-ho-ho!
meld_65_6,Yeah.
meld_65_7,"I mean, no-no-no-no-no, dont you worry, Im sure with your qualifications you wont need to sleep with some guy to get that job."
meld_65_8,"Although, I might need some convincing."
meld_65_9,"Well, I, umm"
meld_65_10,"Kidding! God, I feel wild today!"
meld_66_0,Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
meld_66_1,"Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk."
meld_66_2,"Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his name, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry."
meld_66_3,I think it means he freaked out and left!
meld_66_4,Dont be so negative! Good God! Isnt it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!
meld_66_5,"Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?"
meld_66_6,"LookOkay, Im just gonnaIm gonna have to go find him and bring him back!"
meld_66_7,Okay?
meld_66_8,"You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?"
meld_66_11,"I will, I will find him."
meld_67_0,Hey!
meld_67_1,Hi! Hey!
meld_67_2,Do you guys know any cute guys?
meld_67_3,"Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here."
meld_67_4,"Oh, Im sorry. Thank you Chandler."
meld_67_5,"Anyway, theres this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go"
meld_67_6,Whats the charity?
meld_67_7,"I dont know, something either trees or diseaseRalph mumbles a lot."
meld_67_8,Does Ralph mumble when youre not paying attention?
meld_67_9,Yeah! Its weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
meld_67_10,"Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?"
meld_68_0,Hey!
meld_68_1,What are you guys doing later?
meld_68_2,"Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut."
meld_68_3,We do?
meld_68_4,I want to see what he wants first.
meld_68_5,I just found out that Elizabeths dad wants to meet me.
meld_68_6,"Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not Elizabeths dad?!"
meld_68_7,"Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me."
meld_68_8,It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
meld_68_9,Of course well help! Yeah! Well be here!
meld_68_10,Thanks!
meld_68_11,We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
meld_69_0,"Oh, hi! How are you doing?"
meld_69_1,I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
meld_69_2,"Thanks for having me over, you guys."
meld_69_3,Tag?
meld_69_4,Y-You're going?
meld_69_5,"Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk."
meld_69_6,"Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?"
meld_69_7,Colorado.
meld_69_8,"Ah, what good are you."
meld_69_9,"Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace."
meld_69_10,Okay.
meld_69_11,"Ah, I-I never should have said what I said."
meld_69_12,Ityknow what?
meld_69_13,It just doesn't matter how I feel.
meld_69_14,"I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay?"
meld_69_15,"Um, I'm not."
meld_69_16,"Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out."
meld_69_17,"No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us."
meld_69_18,Really?
meld_69_19,"Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this."
meld_70_0,"Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!"
meld_70_1,"See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks."

meld_70_4,Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
meld_70_5,"Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!"

meld_72_6,"No, but you're questioning my method!"
meld_72_7,"No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid!  What?!"
meld_72_8,Thank you.
meld_72_9,Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
meld_72_10,"Your other student, was you!"
meld_72_11,"Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!"
meld_72_12,"Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!"

meld_74_4,You do?
meld_74_5,"Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first."
meld_74_6,Okay.
meld_74_7,"Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. Thats been one heck of a see-saw hasnt it?"
meld_74_8,What?
meld_74_9,"I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun andand certainly passionate, but dont you think its better if we just stayed friends?"
meld_74_10,Seriously. What?!
meld_74_11,Okay.
meld_74_12,Okay.
meld_74_13,Yknow what?
meld_74_14,"If you want to, we can do it one more time."

meld_74_16,"In fact, I have some time right now."
meld_74_17,"Okay, yknow what? Can I, can I talk now?"
meld_74_18,Oh sure.
meld_74_19,"Im pregnant.  Ross?  Ross?  Okay, whenever youre ready.  And youre the father by the waybut you got that"

meld_76_1,"Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go."
meld_76_2,Okay.

meld_76_5,Hmph.
meld_76_6,"And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her."
meld_76_7,"And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place...."
meld_76_8,"With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!"
meld_76_9,"I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head."
meld_76_10,"And your like 'Mom, get outta here!'"
meld_76_11,"You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing."
meld_76_12,"So it's kinda like, you're, you know."
meld_76_13,You know.... You don't know!
meld_76_14,"Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?"
meld_76_15,You said...
meld_76_16,I said '
meld_77_0,Oh!
meld_77_1,Look at Emma!
meld_77_2,"I just cant decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?"
meld_77_3,"Oh what are you kidding? Shes gorgeous, its all Rachel."
meld_77_4,"Im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two together again?"
meld_77_5,"No, I know."
meld_77_6,"I know, because youre not in that place."
meld_77_7,"Which would be fine, except you totally are."
meld_77_8,Itsits complicated okay?
meld_77_9,"Yeah thats true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer."
meld_77_10,"Look, weve been together."
meld_77_11,Okay?
meld_77_12,"And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby."
meld_77_13,Its just if-if we got together again and it didnt work outI could never do that to Emma.
meld_77_14,I mean she-she thinking everything Oh thatsnow me.
meld_77_15,What do they put something in the water in this place?
meld_77_16,"Since Rachel and I were doing really, were doing really well right now."
meld_77_17,"I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it."
meld_77_18,"Yeah, exactly."
meld_77_19,Right.  Or you might get everything youve wanted since you were fifteen.

meld_78_4,"I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around."
meld_78_5,Uh-oh.
meld_78_6,"Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble."
meld_78_7,Really? You think so?

meld_79_1,"Oh, yeah?"
meld_79_2,Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight?
meld_79_3,"Oh, well... Maybe we could..."
meld_79_4,"Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess?"
meld_79_5,Know your audience!
meld_79_6,"Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
meld_79_7,We really need to take those tests?
meld_79_8,"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year."
meld_79_9,I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
meld_79_10,But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
meld_80_0,"Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?"
meld_80_1,No. Have you seen David?
meld_80_2,"No, no, he hasn't been around."

meld_82_1,"Damn those robots, theyre supposed to be our"
meld_82_2,"Anyway, it wasnt the robot, it was the guy who controls him."
meld_82_3,"Yeah, he doesnt like me."
meld_82_4,He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
meld_82_5,knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one!
meld_82_6,Ohh!
meld_82_7,"Well, why dont you just get him fired?"
meld_82_8,"I may have to, I hate to do it, but Im the star!"
meld_82_9,Yknow?
meld_82_10,Theres a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.
meld_82_11,Excuse me.
meld_82_12,Joey Tribbiani.
meld_82_13,"Joe! Im glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!"
meld_82_14,Wow!
meld_82_15,The thing is its kinda on the Q.T.
meld_82_16,The actor who has the part doesnt know he might be fired.
meld_82_17,"Its the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E."
meld_82_18,Im the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
meld_83_0,Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
meld_83_1,What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
meld_83_2,Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us.
meld_83_3,What?
meld_83_4,"Look, weve always talked about having babies someday."
meld_83_5,"Im not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it."
meld_83_6,Were good.
meld_83_7,Were really good.
meld_84_0,"Oh, did you catch him?!"
meld_84_1,Wh-what did he say?!
meld_84_2,"He said, ""Nice to meet you Glenda.""  Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?"
meld_84_3,Why?! Why not?!
meld_84_4,"Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here!"
meld_84_5,He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
meld_84_6,What did you say to him?
meld_84_7,"Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later."
meld_85_0,"Oh yeah, sure."
meld_85_1,"Okay, in about ten seconds youre gonna see him kiss me."
meld_85_2,And in about five seconds youre gonna see why.
meld_85_3,Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
meld_85_4,"Okay, get ready to see some beggin!"
meld_85_5,"Oh, you came on to Ross!"

meld_85_16,Ken Adams!!
meld_86_0,"How we doing, you guys ready?"
meld_86_1,Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
meld_86_2,Some days it's all I can think about.
meld_86_3,"Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."
meld_87_0,"Oh... ok, fine."
meld_87_1,But... ehm...
meld_87_2,"I just have one question for you,    ehm..."
meld_87_3,"When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll..."
meld_87_4,"Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok,    let's go!!"
meld_88_0,I cant believe this! How long as this been going on?
meld_88_1,"Well umm, Alexandra has been"

meld_88_5,"Well, Phoebe I thought IdYeah, what the hell."
meld_89_0,Ben!
meld_89_1,"Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord."
meld_89_2,Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
meld_89_3,Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?
meld_89_4,"No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring."
meld_89_5,"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry."
meld_89_6,Sorry.
meld_89_7,Sorry!
meld_89_8,I got my s's back!

meld_90_0,"Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye."
meld_90_1,"Rachel, how did this happen?"
meld_90_2,"I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
meld_90_3,Where?
meld_90_4,At his apartment. Is this juice?
meld_90_5,"Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?"
meld_90_6,"Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser."
meld_91_0,"I licked my arm, what?"
meld_91_1,It's breast milk.
meld_91_2,So?
meld_91_3,"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
meld_91_4,What is the big deal?
meld_91_5,What did you just do?
meld_91_6,"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
meld_91_7,You won't even taste it?
meld_91_8,No!
meld_91_9,Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
meld_91_10,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
meld_92_0,Aww!
meld_92_1,"Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet?"
meld_92_2,Oh sure!  Noo!
meld_92_3,Ohh!!
meld_92_4,My apothecary table!!!
meld_92_5,What?!
meld_92_6,Noooooo!!
meld_92_7,"Ross, where did you get this?!"
meld_92_8,"Oh my God, Phoebe,"
meld_92_9,"Wow! Oh my God, well if theyve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!"
meld_92_10,Well this doesnt even smell like opium.
meld_92_11,"Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way."
meld_93_0,How is she?
meld_93_1,"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
meld_93_2,How's the hair?
meld_93_3,"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good."
meld_93_4,"I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
meld_93_5,Can we see her?
meld_93_6,"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in."
meld_93_7,How're you doing?
meld_94_0,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
meld_94_1,"Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it."
meld_94_2,That would be no.
meld_94_3,Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
meld_94_4,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
meld_94_5,Cantaloupe juice.
meld_94_6,Exactly.
meld_94_7,You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
meld_94_8,Uh huh.
meld_94_9,"Oh, you've tasted it."
meld_94_10,"You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true."
meld_94_11,Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.
meld_95_0,I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
meld_95_1,"Yknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnt give you real names either."
meld_95_2,"Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they dont give out fake names."
meld_95_3,"Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you."
meld_95_4,Regina Philange.
meld_95_5,"I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong."
meld_95_6,"I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes."
meld_95_7,I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
meld_95_8,Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
meld_95_9,Well maybe it was all of your questions.
meld_95_10,What about my questions?
meld_96_0,"No, Im sorry. Its just my foot itches like crazy."
meld_96_1,"Oh, Ill get it."
meld_96_2,Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
meld_96_3,"Relax, its not like were forking."
meld_97_0,"Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpapers a little faded, thats okay. Carpets a little loose. Hardwood floors!!"
meld_97_1,Hey!
meld_97_2,Hello.
meld_97_3,Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! Its so beautiful.
meld_97_4,I know!!!
meld_97_5,"So, Im here, ready to play."
meld_97_6,Okay.
meld_97_7,"I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha."
meld_97_8,Whats this?
meld_97_9,"Thats a dog, every house should have a dog."
meld_97_10,Not one that can pee on the roof.
meld_97_11,"Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive waste."
meld_97_12,And is this in case the house sneezes?
meld_97_13,"No, no, thats the ghost for the attic."
meld_97_14,I dont want a ghost.
meld_97_15,"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But youve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
meld_97_16,"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen."
meld_97_17,"Okay, obviously you dont know much about the U.S. government."
meld_97_18,Hey!
meld_97_19,Hello.
meld_97_20,I need to talk to you!
meld_97_21,"Sure, whats up?"
meld_98_0,"All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it."
meld_98_1,"Please, I'm not going for anything."
meld_98_2,"Well, if you don't, I will."
meld_98_3,Would you please go?
meld_98_4,I would!
meld_99_0,"Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!"
meld_99_1,Uh-huh.
meld_99_2,"Watch, watch."
meld_99_3,Ooohhhh!!
meld_99_4,"And, and!"
meld_99_5,Ahhhh!!
meld_99_6,"Hey, my Fathers house does that!"
meld_99_7,"O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything."
meld_99_8,"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening."
meld_100_0,Okay. Its Emma.
meld_101_0,Emma!  See? I dont want it.
meld_102_0,Take it.
meld_102_1,What?
meld_103_0,Its clearly an Emma.
meld_103_1,"Oh honey, but you love that name."
meld_103_2,"Yeah, but I love you more."
meld_103_3,"Besides yknow, nothing goes with Bing."
meld_103_4,So Im screwed.
meld_104_0,"Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, ""Quack, quack!"" Im happy all the time!"
meld_104_1,Nice try.
meld_104_2,"Wait, wait, wait!"
meld_104_3,"Look, Monica"
meld_104_4,Look!
meld_104_5,This is not going to work.
meld_104_6,I bet this will work!
meld_104_7,You are so great! I love you!
meld_104_8,What?
meld_104_9,"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
meld_104_10,You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
meld_104_11,No I didn't!
meld_104_12,"Yes, you did!"
meld_104_13,No I didn't!
meld_104_14,You love me!
meld_104_15,No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
meld_105_0,Hello Greg?
meld_105_1,"Hi, this is Monica from the plane?"
meld_105_2,"Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5   That is their old number!"
meld_105_3,Jennys been giving it out since they moved!
meld_105_4,Jenny! That is so Jenny!
meld_105_5,"Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together?"
meld_105_6,Say next Saturday?
meld_105_7,"Okay, how about Sunday?"
meld_105_8,"Okay umm, the week after that?"
meld_105_9,The week after that?
meld_105_10,Yknow what Greg?
meld_105_11,"We are good, interesting, funny people with"
meld_106_0,Hey Chandler! Yknow that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
meld_106_1,"Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class."
meld_106_2,Whats a Movement class?
meld_106_3,Its Chandlers way of pretending he didnt take mime.
meld_106_4,"Oh well listen, anyway shes directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!"
meld_106_5,"Oh, I dont know man. I havent talked to her in like ten years."
meld_107_0,I am.
meld_107_1,"Joey, what are you talking about? Youre a terrific actor."
meld_107_2,You really think so?
meld_107_3,"Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!"
meld_108_0,Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the
meld_108_1,"Oh, okay, I'm having another one!"
meld_108_2,"This one doesn't hurt eitherOoh, yes it does!"
meld_108_3,Ow!
meld_108_4,Ow!
meld_108_5,Ow!
meld_108_6,Ow!
meld_108_7,Ooh!
meld_108_8,"Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it."
meld_108_9,"Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?"
meld_108_10,"Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!  Hi!"
meld_108_11,Hi!
meld_108_12,"That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!"
meld_108_13,"Oh, honey, dont worry. She's gonna make it on time."
meld_108_14,Yeah.
meld_109_0,I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
meld_109_1,But sadly I could not be enticed.
meld_109_2,Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
meld_109_3,I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
meld_109_4,"Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not."
meld_109_5,Eh?
meld_109_6,"All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket."
meld_109_7,"I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs."
meld_110_0,"Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing."
meld_110_1,Yeah.
meld_110_2,"Well, what period is it from?"
meld_110_3,"Uh, its from yore. Like the days of yore. Yknow?"
meld_110_4,"Yes, yes I do."
meld_110_5,"God, oh its just perfect!"
meld_110_6,I bet it has a great story behind it too.
meld_110_7,Did they tell you anything?
meld_110_8,"Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains."
meld_110_9,"White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place."
meld_111_0,"So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material?"
meld_111_1,Huh?
meld_111_2,I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
meld_112_0,"I, umm, shut up!"
meld_112_1,Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. Ill miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this!
meld_112_2,"Well, its pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?"
meld_112_3,Noooo!!
meld_112_4,"All right, hang on!"
meld_113_0,"Rachel, its going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here."
meld_113_1,But I
meld_113_2,"No-no, wait!"
meld_113_3,"Just let me finish, okay?"
meld_113_4,"This isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want."
meld_113_5,And it
meld_113_6,It is? Really?
meld_113_7,"Yeah, sweetie."
meld_113_8,"I mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore?"
meld_113_9,No.
meld_113_10,What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much!
meld_113_11,Im gonna miss you!
meld_113_12,I mean its the end of an era!
meld_113_13,I know!
