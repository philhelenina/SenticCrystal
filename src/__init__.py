SenticCrystal: Information-Theoretic Framework for Emotion Recognition

SenticCrystal is an information-theoretic framework for emotion recognition that 
"crystallizes" the essential principles of emotion from complex text and speech data.
Through systematic experiments, we discovered that simpler, interpretable models can 
achieve performance comparable to complex architectures.

Core Philosophy:
- Simplicity over Complexity
- Information Crystallization  
- Balanced Understanding
